<h1><span class="GutSmall">THE</span><br />
PHARISEE AND THE PUBLICAN.</h1>
<blockquote><p><i>Two men went up into the temple to pray</i>;
<i>the one a Pharisee</i>, <i>and the other a Publican</i>.&nbsp;
<i>The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself</i>;
<i>God</i>, <i>I thank thee</i>, <i>that I am not as other men
are</i>, <i>extortioners</i>, <i>unjust</i>, <i>adulterers</i>,
<i>or even as this Publican</i>.&nbsp; <i>I fast twice in the
week</i>, <i>I give tithes of all that I possess</i>.&nbsp;
<i>And the Publican</i>, <i>standing afar off would not lift up
so much as his eyes unto heaven</i>, <i>but smote upon his
breast</i>, <i>saying</i>, <i>God be merciful to me a
sinner</i>.&mdash;Luke, xviii. 10&ndash;13.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the beginning of this chapter
you read of the reason of the parable of the unjust judge and the
poor widow; namely, to encourage men to pray.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
spake a parable to this end, that men ought always to pray, and
not to faint;&rdquo; and a most sweet parable for that purpose it
is: for if through importunity, a poor widow woman may prevail
with an unjust judge, and so consequently with an unmerciful and
hard-hearted tyrant, how much more shall the poor, afflicted,
distressed, and tempted people of God, prevail with, and obtain
mercy at the hands of, a loving, just, and merciful God?&nbsp;
The unjust judge would not hearken to, nor regard the cry of, the
poor widow, for a while: &ldquo;But afterward he said within
himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man; yet because this
widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual
coming she weary me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hark,&rdquo; saith
Christ, &ldquo;what the unjust judge saith.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and
night unto him?&mdash;I tell you that he will avenge them
speedily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is therefore a very comfortable parable to such of the
saints as are under hard usage by reason of evil men, their might
and tyranny: for by it we are taught to believe and expect, that
God, though for a while he seemeth not to regard, yet will, in
due time and season, arise and set such in safety from them that
puff at them; Psalm xii. 4.</p>
<p>Let the good Christian pray always; let him pray, and not
faint at seeming delays; for if the widow by importunity
prevailed with the unjust judge, how much more shall he with his
heavenly Father.&nbsp; &ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; says Christ,
&ldquo;that he will avenge them speedily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now, forasmuch as this parable reacheth not (so directly)
the poor Publican in the text, therefore our Lord begins again,
and adds to that other parable, this parable which I have chosen
for my text; by which he designeth two things: First, The
conviction of the proud and self-conceited Pharisee: Secondly,
The raising up and healing of the cast down and dejected
Publican.&nbsp; And observe it, as by the first parable he
chiefly designeth the relief of those that are under the hands of
cruel tyrants, so by this he designeth the relief of those that
lie under the load and burden of a guilty and disquieted
conscience.</p>
<p>This therefore is a parable that is full of singular comfort
to such of the sinners in the world that are clogged with guilt
and sense of sin; and that lie under the apprehensions of, and
that are driven to God by the sense of the judgment that for sin
is due unto them.</p>
<p>In my handling of this text, I shall have respect to these
things&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; To the persons in the text.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; To the condition of the persons in the text.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; To the conclusion that Christ makes upon them
both.</p>
<p><i>First</i>, For the persons.&nbsp; They were, as you see,
far one from another in their own apprehension of themselves; one
good, the other bad; but yet in the judgment of the law, both
alike, both the same, both sinners; for they both stood in need
of mercy.&nbsp; True, the first mentioned did not see it, as the
other poor sinner did; but that altereth not the case: he that is
in the judgment of the law a sinner, is in the judgment of the
law for sin condemned, though in his own judgment he be ever so
righteous.</p>
<p>Men must not be judged, or justified, according to what
themselves do think, but according to the verdict and sentence
that cometh out of the mouth of God about them.&nbsp; Now, the
sentence of God is, &ldquo;All have sinned:&rdquo; &ldquo;There
is none righteous, no, not one;&rdquo; Rom. iii.&nbsp; It is no
matter, then, what the Pharisee did think of himself; God by his
word hath proclaimed him a sinner: a sinner, by reason of
original sin; a sinner, by reason of actual transgression.&nbsp;
Personally, therefore, with reference to the true nature of their
state, they both were sinners, and both by the law under
condemnation.&nbsp; True, the Publican&rsquo;s leprosy was
outward; but the Pharisee&rsquo;s leprosy was inward: his heart,
his soul, his spirit, was as foul, and had as much the plague of
sin, as had the other in his life or conversation.</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, As to their conditions (I do not mean by
condition, so much a habit of mind, as the state that they had
each of them put themselves into by that mind.)&nbsp; &ldquo;The
one,&rdquo; says the text, &ldquo;was a Pharisee, the other a
Publican.&rdquo;&nbsp; A Pharisee: that is, one that hath chosen
to himself such a course of life.&nbsp; A Publican: that is, one
that hath chosen to himself such a course of life.&nbsp; These
terms, therefore, shew the divers courses of life that they had
put themselves into.&nbsp; The Pharisee, as he thought, had put
himself into a condition for heaven and glory; but the Publican
was for this world and his lusts.&nbsp; Wherefore when the
Pharisee stands in the temple, he boasteth of himself and good
condition, but condemneth the Publican, and bitterly inveigheth
against him.&nbsp; But, as I said, their personal state, by the
law, was not at all changed.&nbsp; The Pharisee made himself
never the better; the Publican also abode in his place.</p>
<p>Indeed the Publican is here found to recant, and repent of his
condition, and of the condition that he had put himself into; and
the Pharisee to boast of his.&nbsp; But the Publican&rsquo;s
repentance was not of himself, but of God, who can also, yea, and
sometimes it is evident (Acts ix.) he doth, make Pharisees also
repent of that condition that they have chosen to be in
themselves; Phil. iii. 3&ndash;8.&nbsp; The Pharisee, therefore,
in commending of himself, makes himself never the better; the
Publican also, in condemning of himself, makes himself never the
worse.&nbsp; Nay, contrariwise, the Pharisee, by commending of
himself, makes himself much the worse, ver. 14; and the Publican,
by condemning of himself, makes himself much the better.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I tell you (says Christ) this man went down to his house
justified rather than the other; for every one that exalteth
himself shall be abased: and he that humbleth himself shall be
exalted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, I say, as to men&rsquo;s commending of themselves, yea,
though others should commend them also, that availeth, to
God-ward, nothing at all.&nbsp; &ldquo;For not he that commendeth
himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So then, men in &ldquo;measuring themselves by themselves, and
comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise;&rdquo; 2
Cor. x. 12.</p>
<p>Now, this was the way of the Pharisee; I am not, saith he, as
other men: I am no extortioner, nor unjust, no adulterer, nor yet
as this Publican.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two men went up into the temple to pray;&rdquo; and
they two, as I said, as opposite one to the other, as any two men
that ever went thither to pray.&nbsp; One of them was over
righteous, and the other wicked over much.&nbsp; Some would have
thought, had they not by the word of Christ been otherwise
described, that they had been both of the same religion; for they
both went up into the temple to pray; yea, both to pray, and that
at the same time, as if they did it by appointment, by agreement;
but there was no such thing.&nbsp; The one was a Pharisee, the
other a Publican: for so saith the after words: and therefore
persons as opposite as light and darkness, as fire and water; I
mean, as to their apprehensions one of another.&nbsp; The
Pharisee could not abide the Publican, nor could the Publican
brook the Pharisee; and yet both went up into the temple to
pray.&nbsp; It is strange to see, and yet it is seen, that men
cross in their minds, cross in their principles, cross in their
apprehensions; yea, and cross in their prayers too, should yet
meet together in the temple to pray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two men;&rdquo; men not of the middle sort, and them
too picked out of the best and worst that was: two men, a
Pharisee, and a Publican.</p>
<p>To be a Pharisee was in those days counted honourable for
religion, and for holiness of life.&nbsp; A Pharisee was a man of
esteem and repute among the Jews, though it is a term of reproach
with us; else Paul would not at such a time as he did it, have
said, &ldquo;Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a
Pharisee;&rdquo; Acts xxiii, 6; Phil. iii. 5.&nbsp; For now he
stood upon his purgation and justification, especially it appears
so by the place first named.&nbsp; And far be it from any to
think, that Paul would make use of a colour of wickedness, to
save thereby himself from the fury of the people.</p>
<p>A Publican was in those days counted one of the vilest of men,
as is manifest; because when they are in the word, by way of
discrimination, made mention of, they are ranked with the most
vile and base; therefore they are joined with
sinners&mdash;&ldquo;He eateth with publicans and sinners,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;with harlots.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Publicans and
harlots enter into the kingdom of heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yea, when
our Lord Christ would have the rebellious professor stigmatized
to purpose, he saith, &ldquo;Let him be to thee as an heathen man
and a publican.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We therefore can make no judgment of men upon the outward
appearance of them.&nbsp; Who would have thought, but that the
Pharisee had been a good man? for he was righteous; for he
prayed.&nbsp; And who could have thought, that the other had been
a good man? for he was a Publican; a man, by good men and bad
men, joined with the worst of men, to wit, with sinners, harlots,
heathens.</p>
<p>The Pharisee was a sectarian; the Publican was an
officer.&nbsp; The Pharisee, even because he was a sectarian, was
had the more in esteem; and the Publican, because he was an
officer, was had the more in reproach.&nbsp; To speak a little to
both these:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The Pharisee was a sectarian; one that deviated, that
turned aside in his worshipping from the way of God, both in
matter and manner of worship; for such an one I count a
sectarian.&nbsp; That he turned aside from the matter, which is
the rule of worship, to wit, the written word, it is evident; for
Christ saith, that they rejected the commandments of God, and
made them of no effect, that they might keep their own
traditions.&nbsp; That they turned aside also as to their manner
of worship, and became sectarians, there is with no less
authority asserted&mdash;&ldquo;For all their works they do for
to be seen of men;&rdquo; Acts xxvi. 5; Mark vii. 9&ndash;13;
Matt. xxiii. 5.</p>
<p>Now this being none of the order or ordinance of Christ, and
yet being chosen by, and stuck to of these sort of men, and also
made a singular and necessary part of worship, became a sect, or
bottom for those hypocritical factious men to adhere unto, and to
make of others disciples to themselves.&nbsp; And that they might
be admired, and rendered venerable by the simple people to their
fellows, they loved to go in long robes; they loved to pray in
markets, and in the corners of the streets; they shewed great
zeal for the small things of the law, but had only great words
for things that were substantial&mdash;&ldquo;They made broad
their phylacteries, and enlarged the borders of their
garments;&rdquo; Matt. xxiii.</p>
<p>When I say the Pharisee was a sectarian, I do not mean that
every sectarian is a Pharisee.&nbsp; There were the sects of the
Herodians, of the Alexandrians, and of the Sadducees, with many
others; but to be a Pharisee, was to be of the straitest sect:
&ldquo;After the most straitest sect of our religion, I lived a
Pharisee.&rdquo;&nbsp; That, therefore, of all the sects, was the
most strait and strict.&nbsp; Therefore, saith he, in another
place, &ldquo;I was taught according to the perfect manner of the
law of the fathers.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again, &ldquo;Touching the
law, a Pharisee;&rdquo; Acts xxii. 3; xxvi. 4&ndash;6; Phil. iii.
5.&nbsp; The Pharisee, therefore, did carry the bell, and wear
the garland for religion; for he outdid, he went beyond all other
sectarians in his day.&nbsp; He was strictest, he was the most
zealous; therefore Christ, in his making of this parable, waived
all other sects then in being, and pitched upon the Pharisee as
the man most meet, by whose rejection he might shew forth and
demonstrate the riches of his mercy in its extension to sinners:
&ldquo;Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a
Pharisee:&rdquo; such a brave man as you have heard.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The Publican also went up thither to pray.&nbsp; The
Publican, I told you before, was an officer: an officer that
served the Romans and himself too; for the Romans at that time
were possessors of the land of Jewry (the lot of Israel&rsquo;s
inheritance), and the emperor Tiberius C&aelig;sar placed over
that land four governors, to wit, Pilate, Herod, Philip, and
Lysanias; all these were Gentiles, heathens, infidels; and the
publicans were a sort of inferior men, to whom was let out to
farm, and so men that were employed by these to gather up the
taxes and customs that the heathens had laid upon the Jews to be
paid to the emperor; Luke ii. 1; iii. 1, 2, 12, 13.</p>
<p>But they were a generation of men that were very injurious in
the execution of their office.&nbsp; They would exact and demand
more than was due of the people; yea, and if their demands were
denied, they would falsely accuse those that so denied them to
the governor, and by false accusation obtain the money of the
people, and so wickedly enrich themselves, Luke iii. 13, 14; xix.
2, 8.&nbsp; This was therefore grievous to the Jews, who always
counted themselves a free people, and could never abide to be in
bondage to any.&nbsp; And this was something of the reason, that
they were so generally by all the Jews counted so vile and base,
and reckoned among the worst of men, even as our informers and
bum-bailiffs are with us at this day.</p>
<p>But that which heightened the spirit of the people against
them, and that made them so odious and filthy in their eyes, was
for that (at least so I think) these publicans were not, as the
other officers, aliens, heathens, and Gentiles, but men of their
own nation, Jews, and so the brethren of those that they so
abused.&nbsp; Had they been Gentiles, it had not been wondered
at.</p>
<p>The Publican then was a Jew, a kind of a renegade Jew, that
through the love that he had to unjust gains, fell off in his
affections from his brethren, adhered to the Romans, and became a
kind of servant to them against their brethren, farming the
heathenish taxations at the hand of strangers, and exacting of
them upon their brethren with much cruelty, falsehood, and
extortion.&nbsp; And hence, as I said, it was, that to be a
publican, was to be so odious a thing, so vile a sinner, and so
grievous a man in the eyes of the Jews.&nbsp; Why, this was the
Publican! he was a Jew, and so should have abode with them, and
have been content to share with his brethren in their calamities;
but contrary to nature, to law, to religion, reason, and honesty,
he fell in with the heathen, and took the advantage of their
tyranny to poll, to rob, and impoverish his brethren.</p>
<p>But for proof that the Publican was a Jew.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Publicans are, even then, when compared with, yet
distinguished from, the heathen; &ldquo;Let him be to thee as an
heathen man and a publican,&rdquo; Matt. xviii.; which two terms,
I think, must not here be applied to one and the self-same man,
as if the heathen was a publican, or the publican a heathen; but
to men of two distinct nations, as that publican and harlot is to
be understood of sinners of both sexes.&nbsp; The Publican is not
an harlot, for he is a man, &amp;c., and such a man as has been
described before.&nbsp; So by publicans and sinners, is meant
publicans and such sinners as the Gentiles were; or such as, by
the text, the Publican is distinguished from: where the Pharisee
saith he was not an extortioner, unjust, adulterer, or even as
this Publican.&nbsp; Nor can he by &ldquo;heathen man&rdquo;
intend the person, and by the term publican, the office or place,
of the heathen man; but by publican is meant the renegade Jew, in
such a place, &amp;c., as is yet further manifested by that which
follows.&nbsp; For&mdash;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Those publicans, even every one of them that by name
are made mention of in the New Testament, have such names put
upon them; yea, and other circumstances thereunto annexed, as
doth demonstrate them to be Jews.&nbsp; I remember the names of
no more but three, to wit, Matthew, Levi, and Zaccheus, and they
were all Jews.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; Matthew was a Jew, and the same Matthew was a
publican; yea, and also afterwards an apostle.&nbsp; He was a
Jew, and wrote his gospel in Hebrew: he was an apostle, and is
therefore found among the twelve.&nbsp; That he was a publican
too, is as evident by his own words; for though Mark and Luke, in
their mentioning of his name and apostleship, do forbear to call
him a publican (Mark iii. 18; Luke vi. l6); yet when this Matthew
comes to speak of himself, he calls himself Matthew the publican
(Matth. x. 3); for I count this the self-same Matthew that Mark
and Luke make mention of, because I find no other Matthew among
the apostles but he: Matthew the publican, Matthew the man so
deep in apostacy, Matthew the man of that ill fame among his
brethren.&nbsp; Love, in Mark and Luke, when they counted him
among the apostles, did cover with silence this his publican
state (and it is meet for Peter to call Paul his beloved brother,
when Paul himself shall call himself the chief of sinners); but
faithfulness to the world, and a desire to be abased, that Christ
thereby, and grace by him, might be advanced, made Matthew, in
his evangelical writings, call himself by the name of Matthew the
publican.&nbsp; Nor has he lost thereby; for Christ again to
exalt him (as he hath also done by the apostle Paul), hath set,
by his special providence, the testimony that this Matthew hath
given of his birth, life, death, doctrine, and miracles, in the
front of all the New Testament.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; The next publican that I find by the Testament of
Christ, made mention of by name, is Levi, another of the apostles
of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; This Levi also, by the Holy Ghost in holy
writ, is called by the name of James: not James the brother of
John, for Zebedee was his father; but James the son of
Alpheus.&nbsp; Now I take this Levi also to be another than
Matthew; First, because Matthew is not called the son of Alpheus;
and because Matthew and Levi, or James the son of Alpheus, are
distinctly counted where the names of the apostles are mentioned
(Matt. x. 3) for two distinct persons: and that this Levi, or
James the apostle, was a publican, as was the apostle Matthew,
whom we mentioned before, is evident; for both Mark and Luke do
count him such.&nbsp; First, Mark saith, Christ found him when he
called him, as he also found Matthew, sitting at the receipt of
custom; yea, Luke words it thus: &ldquo;He went forth, and saw a
publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom, and he
said unto him, Follow me;&rdquo; Mark ii. 14; Luke v. 27.</p>
<p>Now, that this Levi, or James the son of Alpheus, was a Jew,
his name doth well make manifest.&nbsp; Besides, had there been
among the apostles any more Gentiles save Simon the Canaanite, or
if this Levi James had been here, I think the Holy Ghost would,
to distinguish him, have included him in the same discriminating
character as he did the other, when he called him &ldquo;Simon
the Canaanite;&rdquo; Matt. x. 4.</p>
<p>Matthew, therefore, and Levi or James, were both publicans,
and, as I think, called both at the same time; were both publican
Jews, and made by grace the apostles of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; The next publican that I find by name made mention
of in the Testament of Christ, is one Zaccheus.&nbsp; And he was
a publican; yea, for ought I know, the master of them all.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There was a man,&rdquo; saith Luke, &ldquo;named Zaccheus,
which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich,&rdquo;
Luke xix. 2.&nbsp; This man, Christ saith, was a son of Abraham,
that is, as other Jews were; for he spake to stop the mouths of
their Pharisaical cavillations.&nbsp; Besides, the Publican
shewed himself to be such an one, when under a supposition of
wronging any man, he had respect to the Jewish law of restoring
four-fold; Exod. xxii. 1; 2 Sam. xii. 6.</p>
<p>It is further manifest that he was a Jew, because Christ puts
him among the lost; to wit, among the lost sheep of the house of
Israel, ver. 10; and Matt. xv. 24; for Zaccheus was one that
might properly be said to be lost, and that in the Jews&rsquo;
account: lost, I say, and that not only in the most common sense,
by reason of transgression against the law, but for that he was
an apostate Jew, not with reference to heathenish religion, but
as to heathenish, cruel, and barbarous actions; and therefore he
was, as the other, by his brethren, counted as bad as heathens,
Gentiles, and harlots.&nbsp; But salvation is come to this house,
saith Christ, and that notwithstanding his publican practice,
forasmuch as he also is the son of Abraham.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Again, Christ, by the parable of the lost sheep, doth
plainly intimate, that the Publican was a Jew.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then
drew near all the publicans and sinners for to hear him, and the
Pharisees and Scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth
sinners, and eateth with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But by what answer doth Christ repel their objections?&nbsp;
Why, he saith, &ldquo;What man of you having an hundred sheep, if
he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the
wilderness, and go after that which is lost until he find
it?&rdquo;&nbsp; Doth he not here, by the lost sheep, mean the
poor publican? plenty of whom, while he preached this sermon,
were there, as objects of the Pharisees&rsquo; scorn, but of the
pity and compassion of Jesus Christ: he did without doubt mean
them.&nbsp; For, pray, what was the flock, and who Christ&rsquo;s
sheep under the law, but the house and people of Israel?&nbsp;
Ezek. xxxiv. 11.&nbsp; So then, who could be the lost sheep of
the house of Israel, but such as were Matthew, James, Zaccheus,
and their companions in their and such like transgressions?</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Besides, had not the publicans been of the Jews, how
easy had it been for the Pharisees to have objected, that an
impertinency was couched in that most excellent parable of the
lost sheep?&nbsp; They might have said, We are offended, because
thou receivest the publicans, and thou for vindication of thy
practice propoundest a parable of lost sheep; but they are the
sinners of the house of Israel, and the publicans are aliens and
Gentiles.&nbsp; I say, how easily might they thus have objected?
but they knew full well, that the parable was pertinent, for that
the publicans were of the Jews, and not of the aliens.&nbsp; Yea,
had they not been Jews, it cannot, it must not be thought, that
Christ (in sum) should call them so; and yet he did do so, when
he called them &ldquo;lost sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, that these publicans were Jews, what follows but that for
this they were a great deal the more abominated by their
brethren; and (as I have also hinted before) it is no marvel that
they were; for a treacherous brother is worse than an open enemy,
Psalm lv. 12, 13; for, if to be debauched in an open and common
transgression is odious, how odious is it for a brother to be so;
for a brother in nature and religion to be so.&nbsp; I say again,
all this they did, as both John insinuates, and Zaccheus
confesses.</p>
<p>The Pharisee, therefore, was not so good, but the Publican was
as bad.&nbsp; Indeed the Publican was a notorious wretch, one
that had a way of transgressing by himself; one that could not be
sufficiently condemned by the Jews, nor coupled with a viler than
himself.&nbsp; It is true, you find him here in the temple at
prayer; not because he retained, in his apostacy, conscience of
the true religion; but God had awakened him, shewed him his sin,
and bestowed upon him the grace of repentance, by which he was
not only fetched back to the temple and prayer, but to his God,
and to the salvation of his soul.</p>
<p>The Pharisee, then, was a man of another complexion, and good
as to his own thoughts of himself; yea, and in the thoughts of
others also, upon the highest and better ground by far.&nbsp; The
Publican was a notorious sinner: the Pharisee was a reputed
righteous man.&nbsp; The Publican was a sinner out of the
ordinary way of sinning; and the Pharisee was a man for
righteousness in a singular way also.&nbsp; The Publican pursued
his villanies, and the Pharisee pursued his righteousness; and
yet they both met in the temple to pray: yea, the Pharisee stuck
to, and boasted in, the law of God: but the Publican did forsake
it, and hardened his heart against his way.</p>
<p>Thus diverse were they in their appearances: the Pharisee very
good, the Publican very bad: but as to the law of God, which
looked upon them with reference to the state of their spirits,
and the nature of their actions, by that they were both found
sinners; the Publican an open, outside one, and the Pharisee a
filthy, inside one.&nbsp; This is evident, because the best of
them was rejected, and the worst of them was received to
mercy.&nbsp; Mercy standeth not at the Publican&rsquo;s badness,
nor is it enamoured with the Pharisee&rsquo;s goodness: it
suffereth not the law to take place on both, though it findeth
them both in sin, but graciously embraceth the most unworthy, and
leaveth the best to shift for himself.&nbsp; And good reason that
both should be dealt with after this manner; to wit, that the
word of grace should be justified upon the soul of the penitent,
and that the other should stand or fall to that which he had
chosen to be his master.</p>
<p>There are three things that follow upon this discourse.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; That the righteousness of man is not of any esteem
with God, as to justification.&nbsp; It is passed by as a thing
of naughtiness, a thing not worth the taking notice of.&nbsp;
There was not so much as notice taken of the Pharisee&rsquo;s
person or prayer, because he came into the temple mantled up in
his own good things.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; That the man that has nothing to commend him to God,
but his own good doings, shall never be in favour with him.&nbsp;
This also is evident from the text: the Pharisee had his own
righteousness, but had nothing else to commend him to God; and
therefore could not by that obtain favour with God, but abode
still a rejected one, and in a state of condemnation.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Wherefore, though we are bound by the law of charity
to judge of men according as in appearance they present
themselves unto us; yet withal, to wit, though we do so judge, we
must leave room for the judgment of God.&nbsp; Mercy may receive
him that we have doomed to hell, and justice may take hold on
him, whom we have judged to be bound up in the bundle of
life.&nbsp; And both these things are apparent by the persons
under consideration.</p>
<p>We, like Joseph, are for setting of Manasseh before Ephraim;
but God, like Jacob, puts his hands across, and lays his right
hand upon the worst man&rsquo;s head, and his left hand upon the
best (Gen. xlviii.), to the amazement and wonderment even of the
best of men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a
Pharisee, and the other a Publican.&nbsp; The Pharisee stood and
prayed thus with himself; God, I thank thee, that I am not as
other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this
Publican.&nbsp; I fast twice in the week I give tithes of all
that I possess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In these words many things are worth the noting.&nbsp; As,</p>
<p><i>First</i>, The Pharisee&rsquo;s definition of
righteousness; the which standeth in two things: 1.&nbsp; In
negatives; 2.&nbsp; In positives.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; In negatives; to wit, what a man that is righteous
must not be: &ldquo;I am no extortioner, no unjust man, no
adulterer, nor yet as this Publican.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; In positives; to wit, what a man that is righteous
must be: &ldquo;I fast twice a-week, I give tithes of all that I
possess,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>That righteousness standeth in negative and positive holiness
is true; but that the Pharisee&rsquo;s definition is,
notwithstanding, false, will be manifest by and by.&nbsp; But I
will first treat of righteousness in the general, because the
text leadeth me to it.</p>
<p>First, then, a man that is righteous, must have negative
holiness; that is, he must not live in actual transgressions; he
must not be an extortioner, unjust, an adulterer, or as the
Publican was.&nbsp; And this the apostle intends, when he saith,
&ldquo;Flee fornication,&rdquo; &ldquo;Flee youthful
lusts,&rdquo; &ldquo;Flee from idolatry;&rdquo; and,
&ldquo;Little children keep yourselves from idols;&rdquo; 1 Cor.
vi. 18; x. 14; 2 Tim. ii. 22; 1 John v. 21.&nbsp; For it is a
vain thing to talk of righteousness, and that ourselves are
righteous, when every observer shall find us in actual
transgression.&nbsp; Yea, though a man shall mix his want of
negative holiness with some good actions, that will not make him
a righteous man.&nbsp; As suppose, a man that is a swearer, a
drunkard, an adulterer, or the like, should, notwithstanding
this, be open-handed to the poor, be a great executor of justice
in his place, be exact in his buying, selling, keeping his
promise with his friend, or the like; these things, yea, many
more such, cannot make him a righteous man; for the beginning of
righteousness is yet wanting in him, which is this negative
holiness: for except a man leave off to do evil, he cannot be a
righteous man.&nbsp; Negative holiness is therefore of absolute
necessity to make one in one&rsquo;s self a righteous man.&nbsp;
This therefore condemns them, that count it sufficient if a man
have some actions that in themselves, and by virtue of the
command, are good, to make him a righteous man, though negative
holiness is wanting.&nbsp; This is as saying to the wicked, Thou
art righteous, and a perverting of the right way of the Lord:
negative holiness, therefore, must be in a man before he can be
accounted righteous.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; As negative holiness is required to declare one a
righteous man; so also positive holiness must be joined
therewith, or the man is unrighteous still.&nbsp; For it is not
what a man is not, but what a man does, that declares him a
righteous man.&nbsp; Suppose a man be no thief, no liar, no
unjust man; or, as the Pharisee saith, no extortioner, nor
adulterer, &amp;c., this will not make a righteous man; but there
must be joined to these, holy and good actions, before he can be
declared a righteous man.&nbsp; Wherefore, as the apostle, when
he pressed the Christians to righteousness, did put them first
upon negative holiness, so he joineth thereto an exhortation to
positive holiness; knowing, that where positive holiness is
wanting, all the negative holiness in the whole world cannot
declare a man a righteous man.&nbsp; When therefore he had said,
&ldquo;But thou, O man of God, flee these things&rdquo; (sin and
wickedness), he adds, &ldquo;and follow after righteousness,
godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness,&rdquo; &amp;c.; 1
Tim. vi. 11.&nbsp; Here Timothy is exhorted to negative holiness,
when he is bid to flee sin.&nbsp; Here also he is exhorted to
positive holiness, when he is bid to follow after righteousness,
&amp;c.; for righteousness can neither stand in negative nor
positive holiness, as severed one from another.&nbsp; That man
then, and that man only, is, as to actions, a righteous man, that
hath left off to do evil, and hath learned to do well, Isa. i.
16, 17; that hath cast off the works of darkness, and put on the
armour of light.&nbsp; &ldquo;Flee youthful lusts (said Paul),
but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that
call on the Lord out of a pure heart;&rdquo; 2 Tim. ii. 22.</p>
<p>The Pharisee, therefore, as to the general description of
righteousness, made his definition right; but as to his person
and personal righteousness, he made his definition wrong.&nbsp; I
do not mean he defined his own righteousness wrong; but I mean
his definition of true righteousness, which standeth in negative
and positive holiness, he made to stoop to justify his own
righteousness, and therein he played the hypocrite in his prayer:
for although it is true righteousness that standeth in negative
and positive holiness; yet that this is not true righteousness
that standeth, but in some pieces and ragged remnants of negative
and positive righteousness.&nbsp; If then the Pharisee would, in
his definition of personal righteousness, have proved his own
righteousness to be good, he must have proved, that both his
negative and positive holiness had been universal; to wit, that
he had left off to act in any wickedness, and that he had given
up himself to the duty enjoined in every commandment: for so the
righteous man is described; Job i. 8; ii. 3.&nbsp; As it is said
of Zacharias and Elisabeth his wife, &ldquo;They were both
righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and
ordinances of the Lord blameless;&rdquo; Luke i. 5, 6.&nbsp; Here
the perfection, that is, the universality, of their negative
holiness is implied, and the universality of their positive
holiness is expressed: they walked in all the commandments of the
Lord; but that they could not do, if they had lived in any
unrighteous thing or way.&nbsp; They walked in all blamelessly,
that is, sincerely, with upright hearts.&nbsp; The
Pharisee&rsquo;s righteousness, therefore, even by his own
implied definition of righteousness, was not good, as is manifest
these two ways&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; His negative holiness was not universal.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; His positive holiness was rather ceremonial than
moral.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; His negative holiness was not universal.&nbsp; He
saith indeed, he was not an extortioner, nor unjust, no
adulterer, nor yet as this Publican: but none of these
expressions apart, nor all, if put together, do prove him to be
perfect as to negative holiness; that is, they do not prove him,
should it be granted, that he was as holy with this kind of
holiness, as himself of himself had testified.&nbsp; For,</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; What though he was no extortioner, he might yet be
a covetous man; Luke xvi. 14.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; What though, as to dealing, he was not unjust to
others, yet he wanted honesty to do justice to his own soul; Luke
xvi. 15.</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; What though he was free from the act of adultery,
he might yet be made guilty by an adulterous eye, against which
the Pharisee did not watch (Matt. v. 28), of which the Pharisee
did not take cognizance.</p>
<p>(4.)&nbsp; What though he was not like the Publican, yet he
was like, yea was, a downright hypocrite; he wanted in those
things wherein he boasted himself, sincerity; but without
sincerity no action can be good, or accounted of God as
righteous.&nbsp; The Pharisee, therefore, notwithstanding his
boast, was deficient in his righteousness, though he would fain
have shrouded it under the right definition thereof.</p>
<p>(5.)&nbsp; Nor doth his positive holiness help him at all,
forasmuch as it is grounded mostly, if not altogether, in
ceremonial holiness: nay, I will recollect myself, it was
grounded partly in ceremonial and partly in superstitious
holiness, if there be such a thing as superstitious holiness in
the world; this paying of tithes was ceremonial, such as came in
and went out with the typical priesthood.&nbsp; But what is that
to positive holiness, when it was but a small pittance by the
by.&nbsp; Had the Pharisee argued plainly and honestly; I mean,
had he so dealt with that law, by which now he sought to be
justified, he should have brought forth positive righteousness in
morals, and should have said and proved it too, that as he was no
wicked man with reference to the act of wickedness, he was indeed
a righteous man in acts of moral virtues.&nbsp; He should, I say,
have proved himself a true lover of God, no superstitious one,
but a sincere worshipper of him; for this is contained in the
first table (Exod. xx.), and is so in sum expounded by the Lord
Christ himself (Mark xii. 30).&nbsp; He should also, in the next
place, have proved himself truly kind, compassionate, liberal,
and full of love and charity to his neighbour; for that is the
sum of the second table, as our Lord doth expound it, saying,
&ldquo;Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;&rdquo; Mark xii.
31.</p>
<p>True, he says, he did them no hurt; but did he do them
good?&nbsp; To do no hurt, is one thing; and to do good, is
another; and it is possible for a man to do neither hurt nor good
to his neighbour.&nbsp; What then, is he a righteous man because
he hath done him no hurt?&nbsp; No, verily; unless, to his power,
he hath also done him good.</p>
<p>It is therefore a very fallacious and deceitful arguing of the
Pharisee, thus to speak before God in his prayers: I am
righteous, because I have not hurt my neighbour, and because I
have acted in ceremonial duties.&nbsp; Nor will that help him at
all to say, he gave tithes of all that he possessed.&nbsp; It had
been more modest to say, that he had paid them; for they, being
commanded, were a due debt; nor could they go before God for a
free gift, because, by the commandment, they were made a payment;
but proud men and hypocrites love so to word it both with God and
man, as at least to imply, that they are more forward to do, than
God&rsquo;s command is to require them to do.</p>
<p>The second part of his positive holiness was superstitious;
for God had appointed no such set fasts, neither more nor less
but just twice a-week: &ldquo;I fast twice a-week.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Ay, but who did command thee to do so, other than by thy being
put upon it by a superstitious and erroneous conscience, doth
not, nor canst thou make to appear.&nbsp; This part, therefore,
of this positive righteousness, was positive superstition, and
abuse of God&rsquo;s law, and a gratification of thy own
erroneous conscience.&nbsp; Hitherto, therefore, thou art
defective in thy so seemingly brave and glorious
righteousness.</p>
<p>Yet this let me say, in commendation of the Pharisee, in my
conscience he was better than many of our English Christians; for
many of them are so far off from being at all partakers of
positive righteousness, that neither all their ministers, Bibles,
and good books, good sermons, nor yet God&rsquo;s judgments, can
persuade them to become so much as negatively holy, that is, to
leave off evil.</p>
<p>The second thing that I take notice of in this prayer of the
Pharisee, is his manner of delivery, as he stood praying in the
temple: &ldquo;God, I thank thee,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that I
am not as other men are.&rdquo;&nbsp; He seemed to be at this
time in more than an ordinary frame, while now he stood in the
presence of the divine Majesty: for a prayer made up of praise,
is a prayer made up of the highest order, and is most like the
way of them that are now in a state beyond prayer.&nbsp; Praise
is the work of heaven; but we see here, that an hypocrite may get
into that vein, even while an hypocrite, and while on earth
below.&nbsp; Nor do I think that this prayer of his was a
premeditated stinted form, but a prayer <i>extempore</i>, made on
a sudden according to what he felt, thought, or understood of
himself.</p>
<p>Here therefore we may see, that even prayer, as well as other
acts of religious worship, may be performed in great hypocrisy;
although I think, that to perform prayer in hypocrisy, is one of
the most daring sins that are committed by the sons of men.&nbsp;
For by prayer, above all duties, is our most direct and immediate
personal approach into the presence of God; as there is an
uttering of things before him, especially a giving to him of
thanks for things received, or a begging that such and such
things might be bestowed upon me.&nbsp; But now, to do these
things in hypocrisy (and it is easy to do them so, when we go up
into the temple to pray), must needs be intolerable wickedness,
and it argueth infinite patience in God, that he should let such
as do so arise alive from their knees, or that he should suffer
them to go away from the place where they stand, without some
token or mark of his wrath upon them.</p>
<p>I also observe, that this <i>extempore</i> prayer of the
Pharisee was performed by himself, or in the strength of his own
natural parts; for so the text implieth.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Pharisee,&rdquo; saith the text, &ldquo;stood and prayed thus
with himself,&rdquo; or &ldquo;by himself,&rdquo; and may
signify, either that he spoke softly, or that he made this prayer
by reason of his natural parts.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will pray with the
Spirit,&rdquo; said Paul; 1 Cor. xiv. 15.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Pharisee prayed with himself,&rdquo; said Christ.&nbsp; It is at
this day wonderfully common for men to pray <i>extempore</i>
also; to pray by a book, by a premeditated set form, is now out
of fashion.&nbsp; He is counted nobody now, that cannot at any
time, at a minute&rsquo;s warning, make a prayer of half an hour
long.&nbsp; I am not against <i>extempore</i> prayer, for I
believe it to be the best kind of praying; but yet I am jealous,
that there are a great many such prayers made, especially in
pulpits and public meetings, without the breathing of the Holy
Ghost in them; for if a Pharisee of old could do so, why not a
Pharisee do the same now?&nbsp; Wit and reason, and notion, are
not screwed up to a very great height; nor do men want words, or
fancies, or pride, to make them do this thing.&nbsp; Great is the
formality of religion this day, and little the power
thereof.&nbsp; Now, where there is a great form, and little power
(and such there was among the Jews, in the time of our Lord and
Saviour Jesus Christ), there men are most strangely under the
temptation to be hypocrites; for nothing doth so properly and
directly oppose hypocrisy, as the power and glory of the things
we profess.&nbsp; And so, on the contrary, nothing is a greater
temptation to hypocrisy, than a form of knowledge of things
without the savour thereof.&nbsp; Nor can much of the power and
savour of the things of the gospel be seen at this day upon
professors (I speak not now of all), if their notions and
conversations be compared together.&nbsp; How proud, how
covetous, how like the world in garb and guise, in words and
actions, are most of the great professors of this our day!&nbsp;
But when they come to divine worship, especially to pray, by
their words and carriage there, one would almost judge them to be
angels in heaven.&nbsp; But such things must be done in
hypocrisy, as also the Pharisee&rsquo;s was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in that it is said he prayed with himself, it may signify,
that he went in his prayer no further than his sense and reason,
feeling and carnal apprehensions went.&nbsp; True Christian
prayer ofttimes leaves sense and reason, feeling and carnal
apprehensions, behind it; and it goeth forth with faith, hope,
and desires to know what at present we are ignorant of, and that
unto which our sense, feeling, reason, &amp;c., are
strangers.&nbsp; The apostle indeed doth say, &ldquo;I will pray
with the understanding;&rdquo; 1 Cor. xiv. 15; but then it must
be taken for an understanding spiritually enlightened.&nbsp; I
say, it must be so understood, because the natural understanding,
as such, receiveth not the things of God, therefore cannot pray
for them; for they to such are foolish things; 1 Cor. ii. 14.</p>
<p>Now, a spiritually enlightened understanding may be officious
in prayer these ways&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; As it has received conviction of the truth of the
being of the Spirit of God; for to receive conviction of the
truth and being of such things, comes from the Spirit of God, not
from the law, sense, or reason; 1 Cor. ii. 10&ndash;12.&nbsp; Now
the understanding having, by the Holy Ghost, received conviction
of the truth of things, draweth out the heart to cry in prayer to
God for them.&nbsp; Therefore he saith, he would pray with the
understanding.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The spiritually enlightened understanding hath also
received, by the Holy Ghost, conviction of the excellency and
glory of the things that are of the Spirit of God, and so
inflameth the heart with more fervent desires in this duty of
prayer; for there is a supernatural excellency in the things that
are of the Spirit: &ldquo;For if the ministration of death (to
which the Pharisee adhered), written and engraven in stones, was
glorious, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly
behold the face of Moses, for the glory of his countenance, which
glory was to be done away; how shall not the ministration of the
Spirit be rather glorious?&nbsp; For if the ministration of
condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of
righteousness exceed in glory: for even that which was made
glorious hath no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory
that excelleth;&rdquo; 2 Cor. iii. 7&ndash;10.&nbsp; And the
Spirit of God sheweth, at least, some things of that excellent
glory of them to the understanding that it enlighteneth; Eph. i.
17&ndash;19.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The spiritually enlightened understanding hath also
thereby received knowledge, that these excellent supernatural
things of the Spirit are given by covenant in Christ to those
that love God, and are beloved of him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now we have
received,&rdquo; says Paul, &ldquo;not the spirit of the world
(that the Pharisee had), but the Spirit which is of God, that we
make know the things that are freely given to us of God;&rdquo; 1
Cor. ii. 12.&nbsp; And this knowledge, that the things of the
Spirit of God are freely given to us of God, puts yet a greater
edge, more vigour, and yet further confidence, into the heart to
ask for what is mine by gift, by a free gift of God in his
Son.&nbsp; But all these things the poor Pharisee was an utter
stranger to; he knew not the Spirit, nor the things of the
Spirit, and therefore must neglect faith, judgment, and the love
of God, Matt. xxiii. 23; Luke xi. 42, and follow himself only, as
to his sense, feeling, reason, and carnal imagination in
prayer.</p>
<p>He stood and prayed thus &ldquo;with himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
prayed thus, talking to himself; for so also it may (I think) be
understood.&nbsp; It is said of the unjust judge, &ldquo;he said
within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man,&rdquo;
&amp;c., Luke xviii. 4; that is, he said it to himself.&nbsp; So
the Pharisee is said to pray with himself: God and the Pharisee
were not together, there was only the Pharisee and himself.&nbsp;
Paul knew not what to pray for without the Holy Ghost joined
himself with him, and helping him with groans unutterable; but
the Pharisee had no need of that; it was enough that he and
himself were together at this work; for he thought without
doubting that he and himself together could do.&nbsp; How many
times have I heard ancient men, and ancient women at it with
themselves, when all alone in some private room, or in some
solitary path; and in their chat they have been sometimes
reasoning, sometimes chiding, sometimes pleading, sometimes
praying, and sometimes singing; but yet all has been done by
themselves when all alone; but yet so done, as one that has not
seen them must needs have concluded that they were talking,
singing, and praying with company, when all that they had said,
they did it with themselves, and had neither auditor nor
regarder.</p>
<p>So the Pharisee was at it with himself; he and himself
performed, at this time, the duty of prayer.&nbsp; Now I observe,
that usually when men do speak to or with themselves, they
greatly strive to please themselves: therefore it is said, there
is a man &ldquo;that flattereth himself in his own eyes, until
his iniquity be found to be hateful;&rdquo; Psalm xxxvi. 2.&nbsp;
He flattereth himself in his own way, according as his sense and
carnal reason dictate to him; and he might do it as well in
prayer as in any other way.&nbsp; Some men will so hear sermons
and apply them that they may please themselves; and some men will
pray, but will refuse such words and thoughts in prayer as will
not please themselves.</p>
<p>O how many men speak all that they speak in prayer, rather to
themselves, or to their auditory, than to God that dwelleth in
heaven.&nbsp; And this I take to be the manner, I mean something
of the manner, of the Pharisee&rsquo;s praying.&nbsp; Indeed, he
made mention of God, as also others do; but he prayed with
himself to himself, in his own spirit, and to his own pleasing,
as the matter of his prayer doth manifest.&nbsp; For was it not
pleasant to this hypocrite, think you, to speak thus well of
himself at this time?&nbsp; Doubtless it was.&nbsp; Also children
and fools are of the same temper with hypocrites, as to this:
they also love, without ground, as the Pharisee, to flatter
themselves in their own eyes; &ldquo;But not he that commendeth
himself is approved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God, I thank thee, I am not as other men are,
extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this
Publican,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>Thus he begins his prayer; and it is, as was hinted before, a
prayer of the highest strain.&nbsp; For to make a prayer all of
thanksgiving, and to urge in that prayer the cause of that
thanksgiving, is the highest manner of praying, and seems to be
done in the strongest faith, &amp;c., in the greatest sense of
things.&nbsp; And such was the Pharisee&rsquo;s prayer, only he
wanted substantial ground for his thanksgiving; to wit, he wanted
proof of that he said, He was not as other men were, except he
had meant, he did not, that he was even of the worst sort of men:
For even the best of men by nature, and the worst, are all
alike.&nbsp; &ldquo;What, then, are we better than they? (saith
Paul), No, in nowise;&rdquo; Rom. iii. 9.&nbsp; So then he failed
in the ground of his thankfulness, and therefore his thankfulness
was grounded on untruth, and so became feigned and
self-flattering, and could not be acceptable with the God of
heaven.</p>
<p>Besides, in this high prayer of the Pharisee, he fathered that
upon God which he could by no means own; to wit, that he being so
good as he thought himself to be, was through distinguishing love
and favour of God&mdash;&ldquo;God, I thank thee, that I am not
as other men are.&rdquo;&nbsp; I thank thee, that thou hast made
me better than others; I thank thee that my condition is so good,
and that I am so far advanced above my neighbour.</p>
<p>There are several things flow from this prayer of the Pharisee
that are worth our observation: as&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; That the Pharisees and hypocrites do not love to
count themselves sinners, when they stand before God.</p>
<p>They choose rather to commend themselves before him for
virtuous and holy persons, sometimes saying, and oftener
thinking, that they are more righteous than others.&nbsp; Yea, it
seems by the word to be natural, hereditary, and so common for
hypocrites to trust to themselves that they are righteous, and
then to condemn others: this is the foundation upon which this
very parable is built: &ldquo;He spake this parable (saith Luke)
unto certain which trusted in themselves as being
righteous,&rdquo; or &ldquo;that they were&rdquo; so, &ldquo;and
despised others,&rdquo; ver. 9.</p>
<p>I say, hypocrites love not to think of their sins, when they
stand in the presence of God; but rather to muster up, and to
present him with their several good deeds, and to venture a
standing or falling by them.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; This carriage of the Pharisee before God informs us,
that moral virtues, and the ground of them, which is the law, if
trusted to, blinds the mind of man that he cannot for them
perceive the way to happiness.&nbsp; While Moses is read (and his
law and the righteousness thereof trusted to), the vail is upon
their heart; and even unto this day (said Paul) the vail
remaineth &ldquo;untaken away in the reading of the Old
Testament, which vail is done away in Christ.&nbsp; But even unto
this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their
heart;&rdquo; 2 Cor. iii. 14, 15.&nbsp; And this is the reason so
many moral men, that are adorned with civil and moral
righteousness, are yet so ignorant of themselves, and the way of
life by Christ.</p>
<p>The law of works, and the righteousness of the flesh, which is
the righteousness of the law, blinds their minds, shuts up their
eyes, and causeth them to miss of the righteousness that they are
so hotly in the pursuit of.&nbsp; Their minds were blinded, saith
the text.&nbsp; Whose minds?&nbsp; Why those that adhered to,
that stood by, and that sought righteousness of the law.&nbsp;
Now,</p>
<p>The Pharisee was such an one; he rested in the law, he made
his boast of God, and trusted to himself that he was righteous;
all this proceeded of that blindness and ignorance that the law
had possessed his mind withal; for it is not granted to the law
to be the ministration of life and light, but to be the
ministration of death, when it speaks; and of darkness, when
trusted unto, that the Son of God might have the pre-eminence in
all things: therefore it is said when the heart &ldquo;shall turn
to him, the vail shall be taken away;&rdquo; 2 Cor. iii. 16.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; We may see by this prayer, the strength of vain
confidence; it will embolden a man to stand in a lie before God;
it will embolden a man to trust to himself, and to what he hath
done; yea, to plead his own goodness, instead of God&rsquo;s
mercy, before him.&nbsp; For the Pharisee was not only a man that
justified himself before men, but that justified himself before
God; and what was the cause of his so justifying himself before
God, but that vain confidence that he had in himself and his
works, which were both a cheat and a lie to himself?&nbsp; But I
say, the boldness of the man was wonderful, for he stood to the
lie that was in his right hand, and pleaded the goodness of it
before him.</p>
<p>But besides these things, there are four things more that are
couched in this prayer of the Pharisee.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; By this prayer the Pharisee doth appropriate to
himself conversion; he challengeth it to himself and to his
fellows.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not,&rdquo; saith he, &ldquo;as other
men;&rdquo; that is, in unconversion, in a state of sin, wrath,
and death: and this must be his meaning, for the religion of the
Pharisee was not grounded upon any particular natural privilege:
I mean not singly, not only upon that, but upon a falling in with
those principles, notions, opinions, decrees, traditions, and
doctrines that they taught distinct from the true and holy
doctrines of the prophets.&nbsp; And they made to themselves
disciples by such doctrine, men that they could captivate by
those principles, laws, doctrines, and traditions: and therefore
such are said to be of the sect of the Pharisees: that is, the
scholars and disciples of them, converted to them and to their
doctrine.&nbsp; O! it is easy for souls to appropriate conversion
to themselves, that know not what conversion is.&nbsp; It is
easy, I say, for men to lay conversion to God, on a legal, or
ceremonial, or delusive bottom, on such a bottom that will sink
under the burden that is laid upon it; on such a bottom that will
not stand when it is brought under the touchstone of God, nor
against the rain, wind, and floods that are ordained to put it to
the trial, whether it is true or false.&nbsp; The Pharisee here
stands upon a supposed conversion to God; &ldquo;I am not as
other men;&rdquo; but both he and his conversion are rejected by
the sequel of the parable: &ldquo;That which is highly esteemed
among men&rdquo; (Luke xvi. 15) &ldquo;is abomination in the
sight of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is, that conversion, that men, as
men, flatter themselves that they have, is such.&nbsp; But the
Pharisee will be a converted man, he will have more to shew for
heaven than his neighbour&mdash;&ldquo;I am not as other men
are;&rdquo; to wit, in a state of sin and condemnation, but in a
state of conversion and salvation.&nbsp; But see how grievously
this sect, this religion, beguiled men.&nbsp; It made them
twofold worse the children of hell than they were before, and
than their teachers were, Matth. xxiii. 15; that is, their
doctrine begat such blindness, such vain confidence, and
groundless boldness in their disciples, as to involve them in
that conceit of conversion that was false, and so if trusted to,
damnable.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; By these words, we find the Pharisee, not only
appropriating conversion to himself, but rejoicing in that
conversion: &ldquo;God, I thank thee,&rdquo; saith he,
&ldquo;that I am not as other men;&rdquo; which saying of his
gives us to see that he gloried in his conversion; he made no
doubt at all of his state, but lived in the joy of the safety
that he supposed his soul, by his conversion, to be in.&nbsp; Oh!
thanks to God, says he, I am not in the state of sin, death, and
damnation, as the unjust, and this Publican is.&nbsp; What a
strange delusion, to trust to the spider&rsquo;s web, and to
think that a few, or the most fine of the works of the flesh,
would be sufficient to bear up the soul in, at, and under the
judgment of God!&nbsp; &ldquo;There is a generation that are pure
in their own eyes, and yet are not washed from their
filthiness.&rdquo;&nbsp; This text can be so fitly applied to
none as the Pharisee, and to those that tread in the
Pharisee&rsquo;s steps, and that are swallowed up with his
conceits, and with the glory of their own righteousness.</p>
<p>So again, &ldquo;There is a way&rdquo; (a way to heaven)
&ldquo;which seemeth right to a man, but the end thereof are the
ways of death;&rdquo; Prov. xxx. 12; xiv. 12.&nbsp; This also is
fulfilled in these kind of men; at the end of their way is death
and hell, notwithstanding their confidence in the goodness of
their state.</p>
<p>Again, &ldquo;There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath
nothing;&rdquo; Prov. xiii. 7.&nbsp; What can be more plain from
all these texts, than that some men that are out of the way think
themselves in it; and that some men think themselves clean, that
are yet in their filthiness, and that think themselves rich for
the next world, and yet are poor, and miserable, and wretched,
and blind, and naked.&nbsp; Thus the poor, blind, naked,
hypocritical Pharisee thought of himself, when God threatened to
abase him: yea, he thought himself thus, and joyed therein, when
indeed he was going down to the chambers of death.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; By these words, the Pharisee seems to put the
goodness of his condition upon the goodness of God.&nbsp; I am
not as other men are, and I thank God for it.&nbsp; &ldquo;God
(saith he), I thank thee, that I am not as other men
are.&rdquo;&nbsp; He thanked God, when God had done nothing for
him.&nbsp; He thanked God, when the way that he was in was not of
God&rsquo;s prescribing, but of his own inventing.&nbsp; So the
persecutor thanks God that he was put into that way of roguery
that the devil had put him into, when he fell to rending and
tearing of the church of God; &ldquo;Their possessors slay them
(saith the prophet), and hold themselves not guilty: and they
that sell them say, Blessed be the Lord, for I am rich;&rdquo;
Zech. xi. 5.&nbsp; I remember that Luther used to say, &ldquo;In
the name of God begins all mischief.&rdquo;&nbsp; All must be
fathered upon God: the Pharisee&rsquo;s conversion must be
fathered upon God; the right, or rather the villany of the
outrageous persecution against God&rsquo;s people, must be
fathered upon God.&nbsp; &ldquo;God, I thank thee,&rdquo; and,
&ldquo;Blessed be God,&rdquo; must be the burden of the
heretic&rsquo;s song.&nbsp; So again, the free-willer, he will
ascribe all to God; the Quaker, the Ranter, the Socinian,
&amp;c., will ascribe all to God.&nbsp; &ldquo;God, I thank
thee,&rdquo; is in every man&rsquo;s mouth, and must be entailed
to every error, delusion, and damnable doctrine that is in the
world: but the name of God, and their doctrine, worship, and way,
hangeth together, as the Pharisee&rsquo;s doctrine; that is to
say, by nothing at all: for God hath not proposed their
principles, nor doth he own them, nor hath he commanded them, nor
doth he convey by them the least grace or mercy to them; but
rather rejecteth them, and holdeth them for his enemies, and for
the destroyers of the world.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; We come, in the next place, to the ground of all
this, and that is, to what the Pharisee had attained; to wit,
that he was no extortioner, no unjust man, no adulterer, nor even
as this Publican, and for that he fasted twice a-week, and paid
tithes of all that he possessed.&nbsp; So that you see he
pretended to a double foundation for his salvation, a moral and a
ceremonial one; but both very lean, weak, and feeble: for the
first of his foundation, what is it more, if all be true that he
saith, but a being removed a few inches from the vilest men in
their vilest actions? a very slender matter to build my
confidence for heaven upon.</p>
<p>And for the second part of his ground for life, what is it but
a couple of ceremonies, if so good? the first is questioned as a
thing not founded in God&rsquo;s law; and the second is such, as
is of the remotest sort of ceremonies, that teach and preach the
Lord Jesus.&nbsp; But suppose them to be the best, and his
conformity to them the thoroughest, they never were ordained to
get to heaven by, and so are become but a sandy foundation.&nbsp;
But any thing will serve some men for a foundation and support
for their souls, and to build their hopes of heaven upon.&nbsp; I
am not a drunkard, says one, nor a liar, nor a swearer, nor a
thief, and therefore I thank God, I have hopes of heaven and
glory.&nbsp; I am not an extortioner, nor an adulterer; not
unjust, nor yet as this Publican; and therefore do hope I shall
go to heaven.&nbsp; Alas, poor men! will your being furnished
with these things save you from the thundering claps and vehement
batteries that the wrath of God will make upon sin and sinners in
the day that shall burn like an oven?&nbsp; No, no; nothing at
that day can shroud a man from the hot rebukes of that vengeance,
but the very righteousness of God, which is not the righteousness
of the law, however christened, named, or garnished with all the
righteousness of man.</p>
<p>But, O thou blind Pharisee! since thou art so confident that
thy state is good, and thy righteousness is that that will stand
when it shall be tried with fire (1 Cor. iii. 13), let me now
reason with thee of righteousness.&nbsp; My terror shall not make
thee afraid; I am not God, but a man as thou art; we both are
formed out of the clay.</p>
<p><i>First</i>, Prithee, when didst thou begin to be
righteous?&nbsp; Was it before or after thou hadst been a
sinner?&nbsp; Not before, I dare say; but if after, then the sins
that thou pollutedst thyself withal before, have made thee
incapable of acting legal righteousness: for sin, where it is,
pollutes, defiles, and makes vile the whole man; therefore thou
canst not by after acts of obedience make thyself just in the
sight of that God thou pretendest now to stand praying
unto.&nbsp; Indeed thou mayst cover thy dirt, and paint thy
sepulchre; for that acts of after obedience will do, though sin
has gone before.&nbsp; But, Pharisee, God can see through the
white of this wall, even to the dirt that is within: God can also
see through the paint and garnish of thy beauteous sepulchre, to
the dead men&rsquo;s bones that are within; nor can any of thy
most holy duties, nor all when put together, blind the eye of the
all-seeing Majesty from beholding all the uncleanness of thy soul
(Matt. xxiii. 27.)&nbsp; Stand not therefore so stoutly to it,
now thou art before God; sin is with thee, and judgment and
justice is before him.&nbsp; It becomes thee, therefore, rather
to despise and abhor this life, and to count all thy doings but
dross and dung, and to be content to be justified with
another&rsquo;s righteousness instead of thy own.&nbsp; This is
the way to be secured.&nbsp; I say, blind Pharisee, this is the
way to be secured from the wrath which is to come.</p>
<p>There is nothing more certain than this, that as to
justification from the curse of the law, God has rejected
man&rsquo;s righteousness, for the weakness and unprofitableness
thereof, and hath accepted in the room of that the glorious
righteousness of his Son; because indeed that, and that only, is
universal, perfect, and equal with his justice and
holiness.&nbsp; This is in a manner the contents of the whole
Bible, and therefore must needs be more certainly true.&nbsp; Now
then, Mr Pharisee, methinks, what if thou didst this, and that
while thou art at thy prayers, to wit, cast in thy mind what doth
God love most? and the resolve will be at hand.&nbsp; The best
righteousness, surely the best righteousness; for that thy reason
will tell thee: This done, even while thou art at thy devotion,
ask thyself again, But who has the best righteousness? and that
resolve will be at hand also; to wit, he that in person is equal
with God, and that is his in Jesus Christ; he that is separate
from sinners, and made higher than the heavens, and that is his
Son Jesus Christ; he that did no sin, nor had any guile found in
his mouth; and there never was any such he in all the world but
the Son of God, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Now, Pharisee, when thou hast done this, then, as thou art at
thy devotion, ask again, But what is this best righteousness, the
righteousness of Christ, to do? and the answer will be
ready.&nbsp; It is to be made by an act of the sovereign grace of
God over to the sinner that shall dare to trust thereto for
justification from the curse of the law.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is made
unto us of God, righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He hath made
him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the
righteousness of God in him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;For Christ is
the end of the law for righteousness to every one that
believeth;&rdquo; 1 Cor. i. 30; 2 Cor. v. 21; Rom. x. 4.</p>
<p>This done, and concluded on, then turn again, Pharisee, and
say thus with thyself&mdash;Is it most safe for me to trust in
this righteousness of God, this righteousness of God-man, this
righteousness of Christ?&nbsp; Certainly it is; since, by the
text, it is counted the best, and that which is best pleaseth
God; since it is that which God hath appointed, that sinners
shall be justified withal.&nbsp; For &ldquo;in the Lord have we
righteousness&rdquo; if we believe: and, &ldquo;in the Lord we
are justified, and do glory;&rdquo; Isa. xlv. 24, 25.</p>
<p>Nay, Pharisee, suppose thine own righteousness should be as
long, as broad, as high, as deep, as perfect, as good, even every
way as good, as the righteousness of Christ; yet since God has
chosen, by Christ, to reconcile us to himself, canst thou attempt
to seek by thy own righteousness to reconcile thyself to God, and
not attempt (at least) to confront this righteousness of Christ
before God; yea, to challenge it by acceptance of thy person
contrary to God&rsquo;s design?</p>
<p>Suppose, that when the king has chosen one to be judge in the
land, and has determined that he shall be judge in all cases, and
that by his verdict every man&rsquo;s judgment shall stand; I
say, suppose, after this, another should arise, and of his own
head resolve to do his own business himself.&nbsp; Now, though he
should be every whit as able, yea, and suppose he should do it as
justly and righteously too, yet his making of himself a judge,
would be an affront to the king, and an act of rebellion, and so
a transgression worthy of punishment.</p>
<p>Why, Pharisee, God hath appointed, that by the righteousness
of his Son, and by that righteousness only, men shall be
justified in his sight from the curse of the law.&nbsp;
Wherefore, take heed, and at thy peril, whatever thy
righteousness is, confront not the righteousness of Christ
therewith.&nbsp; I say, bring it not in, let it not plead for
thee at the bar of God, nor do thou plead for that in his court
of justice; for thou canst not do this and be innocent.&nbsp; If
he trust to his righteousness, he hath sinned, says
Ezekiel.&nbsp; Mark the text, &ldquo;When I shall say to the
righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his own
righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his righteousness shall
not be remembered: but for his iniquity that he hath committed,
he shall die for it;&rdquo; Ezek. xxxiii. 13.</p>
<p>Observe a few things from this text; and they are these that
follow.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Here is a righteous man; a man with whom we do not
hear that the God of heaven finds fault.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Here is a promise made to this man, that he shall
surely live; but on this condition, that he trust not to his own
righteousness.&nbsp; Whence it is manifest, that the promise of
life to this righteous man, is not for the sake of his
righteousness, but for the sake of something else; to wit, the
righteousness of Christ.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Not for the sake of his own righteousness.&nbsp; This
is evident, because we are permitted, yea, commanded, to trust in
the righteousness that saveth us.&nbsp; The righteousness of God
is unto us all, and upon all that believe; that is, trust in it,
and trust to it for justification.&nbsp; Now therefore, if thy
righteousness, when most perfect, could save thee, thou mightst,
yea oughtst, most boldly to trust therein.&nbsp; But since thou
art forbidden to trust to it, it is evident it cannot save; nor
is it for the sake of that, that the righteous man is saved; Rom.
iii. 21, 22.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; But for the sake of something else, to wit, for the
sake of the righteousness of Christ, &ldquo;Whom God hath set
forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare
his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past,
through the forbearance of God; to declare, I say, at this time
his righteousness, that he might be just, and the justifier of
him that believeth in Jesus;&rdquo; Rom. iii. 25, 26; see Phil.
iii. 6&ndash;8.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he trust to his own righteousness, and commit
iniquity, all his righteousness shall not be remembered; but for
his iniquity that he hath committed (in trusting to his own
righteousness), he shall die for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Note hence further.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; That there is more virtue in one sin to destroy, than
in all thy righteousness to save thee alive.&nbsp; If he trust,
if he trust ever so little, if he do at all trust to his own
righteousness, all his righteousness shall be forgotten; and by,
and for, and in, the sin that he hath committed, in trusting to
it, he shall die.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Take notice also, that there are more damnable sins
than those that are against the moral law.&nbsp; By which of the
ten commandments is trusting to our own righteousness
forbidden?&nbsp; Yet it is a sin: it is a sin therefore forbidden
by the gospel, and is included, lurketh close in, yea, is the
very root of, unbelief itself; &ldquo;He that believes not shall
be damned.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he that trusteth in his own
righteousness doth not believe, neither in the truth, nor
sufficiency of the righteousness of Christ to save him, therefore
he shall be damned.</p>
<p>But how is it manifest, that he that trusteth to his own
righteousness, doth it through a doubt, or unbelief of the truth
or sufficiency of the righteousness of Christ?</p>
<p>I answer, because he trusteth to his own.&nbsp; A man will
never willingly choose to trust to the worst of helps, when he
believes there is a better as near, and to be had as soon, and
that too, upon as easy, if not more easy terms.&nbsp; If he that
trusteth to his own righteousness for life, did believe that
there is indeed such a thing as the righteousness of Christ to
justify, and that this righteousness of Christ has in it
all-sufficiency to do that blessed work, be sure he would choose
that, thereon to lay, lean, and venture his soul, that he saw was
the best, and most sufficient to save; especially when he saw
also (and see that he must, when he sees the righteousness of
Christ), to wit, that that is to be obtained as soon, because as
near, and to be had on as easy terms: nay, upon easier than
man&rsquo;s own righteousness.&nbsp; I say, he would sooner
choose it, because of the weight of salvation, of the worth of
salvation, and of the fearful sorrow that to eternity will
overtake him that in this thing shall miscarry.&nbsp; It is for
heaven, it is to escape hell, wrath, and damnation, saith the
soul; and therefore I will, I must, I dare not but choose that,
and that only, that I believe to be the best and most sufficient
help in so great a concern as soul-concern is.&nbsp; So then he
that trusteth to his own righteousness, does it of unbelief of
the sufficiency of the righteousness of Christ to save him.</p>
<p>Wherefore this sin of trusting to his own righteousness is a
most high transgression; because it contemneth the righteousness
of Christ, which is the only righteousness that is sufficient to
save from the curse of the law.&nbsp; It also disalloweth the
design of heaven, and the excellency of the mystery of the wisdom
of God, in designing this way of salvation for man.&nbsp; What
shall I say, It also seeketh to rob God of the honour of the
salvation of man.&nbsp; It seeketh to take the crown from the
head of Christ, and to set it upon the hypocrite&rsquo;s head;
therefore, no marvel that this one sin be of that weight, virtue,
and power, as to sink that man and his righteousness into hell,
that leaneth thereon, or trusteth unto it.</p>
<p>But, Pharisee, I need not talk thus unto thee; for thou art
not the man that hath that righteousness that God findeth not
fault withal; nor is it to be found, but with him that is
ordained to be the Saviour of mankind; nor is there any such one
besides Jesus, who is called Christ.&nbsp; What madness then has
brought thee into the temple, there in an audacious manner to
stand and vaunt before God, saying, &ldquo;God, I thank thee, I
am not as other men are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dost thou not know, that he that breaks one, breaks all the
commandments of God; and consequently, that he that keeps not
all, keeps none at all of the commandments of God?&nbsp; Saith
not the scripture the same?&nbsp; &ldquo;For whosoever shall keep
the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of
all;&rdquo; Jam. ii. 10.&nbsp; Be confounded then, be
confounded.</p>
<p>Dost thou know the God with whom now thou hast to do?&nbsp; He
is a God that cannot (as he is just) accept of an half
righteousness for a whole; of a lame righteousness for a sound;
of a sick righteousness for a well and healthy one; Mal. i. 7,
8.&nbsp; And if so, how should he then accept of that which is no
righteousness?&nbsp; I say, how should he accept of that which is
none at all, for thine is only such?&nbsp; And if Christ said,
&ldquo;When you have done all, say, We are unprofitable,&rdquo;
how camest thou to say, before thou hadst done one thing well, I
am better, more righteous than other men?</p>
<p>Didst thou believe, when thou saidst it, that God knew thy
heart?&nbsp; Hadst thou said this to the Publican, it had been a
high and rampant expression; but to say this before God, to the
face of God, when he knew that thou wert vile, and a sinner from
the womb, and from the conception, spoils all.&nbsp; It was
spoken to put a check to thy arrogancy when Christ said,
&ldquo;Ye are they that justify yourselves before men; but God
knoweth your hearts;&rdquo; Luke xvi. 15.</p>
<p>Hast thou taken notice of this, that God judgeth the fruit by
the heart from whence it comes?&nbsp; &ldquo;A good man, out of
the good treasure of his heart, bringeth forth that which is
good; and an evil man, out of the evil treasure of his heart,
bringeth forth that which is evil;&rdquo; Luke vi. 45.&nbsp; Nor
can it be otherwise concluded, but that thou art an evil man, and
so that all thy supposed good is nought but badness; for that
thou hast made it to stand in the room of Jesus, and hast dared
to commend thyself to the living God thereby: for thou hast
trusted in thy shadow of righteousness, and committed
iniquity.&nbsp; Thy sin hath melted away thy righteousness, and
turned it to nothing but dross; or, if you will, to the early
dew, like to which it goeth away, and so can by no means do thee
good, when thou shalt stand in need of salvation and eternal life
of God.</p>
<p>But, further, thou sayst thou art righteous; but they are but
vain words.&nbsp; Knowest thou not that thy zeal, which is the
life of thy righteousness, is preposterous in many things?&nbsp;
What else means thy madness, and the rage thereof, against men as
good as thyself.&nbsp; True, thy being ignorant that they are
good, may save thee from the commission of the sin that is
unpardonable; but it will never keep thee from spot in
God&rsquo;s sight, but will make both thee and thy righteousness
culpable.</p>
<p>Paul, who was once as brave a Pharisee as thou canst be,
calleth much of that zeal which he in that estate was possessed
with, and lived in the exercise of, madness; yea, exceeding
madness (Acts xxvi. 9&ndash;11; Phil, iii. 5, 6); and of the same
sort is much of thine, and it must be so; for a lawyer, a man for
the law, and that resteth in it, must be a persecutor; yea, a
persecutor of righteous men, and that of zeal to God; because by
the law is begotten, through the weakness that it meeteth with in
thee, sourness, bitterness of spirit, and anger against him that
rightfully condemneth thee of folly, for choosing to trust to thy
own righteousness when a better is provided of God to save us;
Gal. iv. 28&ndash;31.&nbsp; Thy righteousness therefore is
deficient; yea, thy zeal for the law, and the men of the law, has
joined madness with thy moral virtues, and made thy righteousness
unrighteousness: how then canst thou be upright before the
Lord?</p>
<p>Further, has not the pride of thy spirit in this hotheaded
zeal for thy Pharisaical notions run thee upon thinking that thou
art able to do more than God hath enjoined thee, and so able to
make thyself more righteous than God requireth thou shouldst
be?&nbsp; What else is the cause of thy adding laws to
God&rsquo;s laws, precepts to God&rsquo;s precepts, and
traditions to God&rsquo;s appointment?&nbsp; Mark vii.&nbsp; Nay,
hast thou not, by thus doing, condemned the law of want of
perfection, and so the God that gave it, of want of wisdom and
faithfulness to himself and thee?</p>
<p>Nay, I say again, hath not thy thus doing charged God with
being ignorant of knowing what rules there needed to be imposed
on his creatures to make their obedience complete?&nbsp; And doth
not this madness of thine intimate, moreover, that if thou hadst
not stepped in with the bundle of thy traditions, righteousness
had been imperfect, not through man&rsquo;s weakness, but through
impediment in God, or in his ministering rules of righteousness
unto us?</p>
<p>Now, when thou hast thought on these things, fairly answer
thyself these few questions.&nbsp; Is not this arrogancy?&nbsp;
Is not this blasphemy?&nbsp; Is not this to condemn God, that
thou mightst be righteous?&nbsp; And dost thou think, this is
indeed the way to be righteous?</p>
<p>But again, what means thy preferring of thine own rules, laws,
statutes, ordinances, and appointments, before the rules, laws,
statutes, and appointments of God?&nbsp; Thinkest thou this to be
right?&nbsp; Whither will thy zeal, thy pride, and thy folly
carry thee?&nbsp; Is there more reason, more equity, more
holiness in thy tradition, than in the holy, and just, and good
commandments of God?&nbsp; Rom. vii. 12.&nbsp; Why then, I say,
dost thou reject the commandment of God, to keep thine own
tradition?&nbsp; Yea, why dost thou rage, and rail, and cry out,
when men keep not thy law, or the rule of thine order, and
tradition of thine elders, and yet shut thine eyes, or wink with
them, when thou thyself shalt live in the breach of the law of
God?&nbsp; Yea, why wilt thou condemn men, when they keep not thy
law, but study for an excuse, yea, plead for them that live in
the breach of God&rsquo;s?&nbsp; Mark vii. 10&ndash;13.&nbsp;
Will this go for righteousness in the day of God Almighty?&nbsp;
Nay, rather, will not this, like a mill-stone about thy neck,
drown thee in the deeps of hell?&nbsp; O the blindness, the
madness, the pride, that dwells in the hearts of these pretended
righteous men</p>
<p>Again, What kind of righteousness of thine is this that
standeth in a mis-esteeming of God&rsquo;s commands?&nbsp; Some
thou settest too high, and some too low; as in the text, thou
hast set a ceremony above faith, above love, and above hope in
the mercy of God; when as it is evident, the things last
mentioned, are the things of the first rate, the weightier
matters; Matt. xxiii. 17.</p>
<p>Again, Thou hast preferred the gold above the temple that
sanctifieth the gold; and the gift above the altar that
sanctifieth the gift; Matt. xxiii. 17.</p>
<p>I say again, What kind of righteousness shall this be
called?&nbsp; What back will such a suit of apparel fit, that is
set together to what it should be?&nbsp; Nor can other
righteousness proceed, where a wrong judgment precedeth it.</p>
<p>This misplacing of God&rsquo;s laws cannot, I say, but produce
misplaced obedience.&nbsp; It indeed produceth a monster, an
ill-shaped thing, unclean, and an abomination to the Lord.&nbsp;
For &ldquo;see,&rdquo; saith he (if thou wilt be making),
&ldquo;that thou make all things according to the pattern shewn
thee in the mount.&rdquo;&nbsp; Set faith, where faith should
stand; a moral, where a moral should stand; and a ceremony, where
a ceremony should stand: for this turning of things upside down
shall be esteemed as the potter&rsquo;s clay.&nbsp; And wilt thou
call this thy righteousness? yea, wilt thou stand in this? wilt
thou plead for this? and venture an eternal concern in such a
piece of linsey-woolsey as this?&nbsp; O fools, and blind!</p>
<p>But, further, let us come a little closer to the point.&nbsp;
O blind Pharisee, thou standest to thy righteousness: what dost
thou mean?&nbsp; Wouldst thou have mercy for thy righteousness,
or justice for thy righteousness.</p>
<p>If mercy, what mercy?&nbsp; Temporal things God giveth to the
unthankful and unholy: nor doth he use to sell the world to man
for righteousness.&nbsp; The earth hath he given to the children
of men.&nbsp; But this is not the thing: thou wouldst have
eternal mercy for thy righteousness; thou wouldst have God think
upon what an holy, what a good, what a righteous man thou art and
hast been.&nbsp; But Christ died not for the good and righteous,
nor did he come to call such to the banquet that grace hath
prepared for the world.&nbsp; &ldquo;I came not,&mdash;I am not
come (saith Christ) to call the righteous, but sinners to
repentance;&rdquo; Mark ii.; Rom. v.&nbsp; Yet this is thy plea;
Lord, God, I am a righteous man; therefore grant me mercy, and a
share in thy heavenly kingdom.&nbsp; What else dost thou mean
when thou sayst, &ldquo;God I thank thee, that I am not as other
men are?&rdquo;&nbsp; Why dost thou rejoice, why art thou glad
that thou art more righteous (if indeed thou art) than thy
neighbour, if it is not because thou thinkest that thou hast got
the start of thy neighbour, with reference to mercy; and that by
thy righteousness thou hast insinuated thyself into God&rsquo;s
affections, and procured an interest in his eternal favour?&nbsp;
But,</p>
<p>What, what hast thou done by thy righteousness?&nbsp; I say,
What hast thou given to God thereby?&nbsp; And what hath he
received of thy hand?&nbsp; Perhaps thou wilt say, righteousness
pleaseth God: but I answer no, not thine, with respect to
justification from the curse of the law, unless it be as perfect
as the justice it is yielded to, and as the law that doth command
it.&nbsp; But thine is not such a righteousness: no, thine is
speckled, thine is spotted, thine makes thee to look like a
speckled bird in his eye-sight.</p>
<p>Thy righteousness has added iniquity, because it has kept thee
from a belief of thy need of repentance, and because it has
emboldened thee to thrust thyself audaciously into the presence
of God, and made thee even before his holy eyes, which are so
pure, that they cannot look on iniquity (Hab. i. 13), to vaunt,
boast, and brag of thyself; and of thy tottering, ragged,
stinking uncleanness; for all our righteousnesses are as
menstruous rags, because they flow from a thing, a heart, a man,
that is unclean.&nbsp; But,</p>
<p>Again, Wouldst thou have mercy for thy righteousness?&nbsp;
For whom wouldst thou have it: for another, or for thyself?&nbsp;
If for another (and it is most proper that a righteous man should
intercede for another by his righteousness, rather than for
himself), then thou thrustest Christ out of his place and office,
and makest thyself to be a saviour in his stead; for a mediator
there is already, even a mediator between God and man, and he is
the man Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>But dost thou plead by thy righteousness for mercy for
thyself?&nbsp; Why, in doing so, thou impliest&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; That thy righteousness can prevail with God more than
can thy sins; I say, that thy righteousness can prevail with God
to preserve thee from death more than thy sins can prevail with
him to condemn thee to it.&nbsp; And if so, what follows, but
that thy righteousness is more, and has been done in a fuller
spirit than ever were thy sins?&nbsp; But thus to insinuate, is
to insinuate a lie; for there is no man but, while he is a
sinner, sinneth with a more full spirit than a good man can act
righteousness withal.</p>
<p>A sinner, when he sinneth, he doth it with all his heart, and
with all his mind, and with all his soul, and with all his
strength; nor hath he in his ordinary course any thing that
bindeth.&nbsp; But with a good man it is not so; all and every
whit of himself, neither is, nor can be, in every good duty that
he doth.&nbsp; For when he would do good, evil is the Spirit, and
the Spirit against the flesh, and these are present with
him.&nbsp; And again, &ldquo;The flesh lusteth against one to the
other, so that ye cannot do the things would;&rdquo; Gal. v.
17.</p>
<p>Now, if a good man cannot do good things with that oneness and
universalness of mind, as a wicked man doth sin with, then is his
sin heavier to weigh him down to hell than is his righteousness
to buoy him up to the heavens.</p>
<p>And again, I say, if the righteousness of a good man comes
short of his sin, both in number, weight, and measure, as it doth
(for a good man shrinks and quakes at the thoughts of God&rsquo;s
entering into judgment with him, Psalm cxliii. 2); then is his
iniquity more than his righteousness.&nbsp; And I say again, if
the sin of one that is truly gracious, and so of one that hath
the best of principles, is heavier and mightier to destroy him
than is his righteousness to save him, how can it be that the
Pharisee, that is not gracious, but a mere carnal man (somewhat
reformed and painted over with a few lean and low formalities),
should with his empty, partial, hypocritical righteousness
counterpoise his great, mighty, and weighty sins, that have
cleaved to him in every state and condition of his, to make him
odious in the sight of God?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Dost thou plead by thy righteousness for mercy for
thyself?&nbsp; Why in so doing thou impliest, that mercy thou
deservest; and that is next door to, or almost as much as to say,
God oweth me what I ask for.&nbsp; The best that can be put upon
it is, thou seekest security from the direful curse of God, as it
were by the works of the law, Rom. ix. 31&ndash;33; and to be
sure, betwixt Christ and the law, thou wilt drop into hell.&nbsp;
For he that seeks for mercy, as it were, and but as it were, by
the works of the law, doth not altogether trust thereto.&nbsp;
Nor doth he that seeks for that righteousness that should save
him as it were by the works of the law, seek it only wholly and
solely at the hands of mercy.</p>
<p>So then, to seek for that that should save thee, neither at
the hands of the law, nor at the hands of mercy, is to be sure to
seek it where it is not to be found; for there is no medium
betwixt the righteousness of the law and the mercy of God.&nbsp;
Thou must have it either at the door of the law, or at the door
of grace.&nbsp; But sayst thou, I am for having of it at the
hands of both.&nbsp; I will trust solely to neither.&nbsp; I love
to have two strings to my bow.&nbsp; If one of them, as you
think, can help me by itself, my reason tells me that both can
help me better.&nbsp; Therefore will I be righteous and good, and
will seek by my goodness to be commended to the mercy of God: for
surely he that hath something of his own to ingratiate himself
into the favour of his prince withal, shall sooner obtain his
mercy and favour, than one that comes to him stripped of all
good.</p>
<p>I answer, But there are not two ways to heaven: there is but
one new and living way which Christ hath consecrated for us
through the vail, that is to say, his flesh; and besides that
one, there is no more; Heb. x. 19&ndash;24.&nbsp; Why then dost
thou talk of two strings to thy bow?&nbsp; What became of him
that had, and would have two stools to sit on? yea, the text says
plainly, that therefore they obtained not righteousness, because
they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the
law.&nbsp; See here, they are disowned by the gospel, because
they sought it not by faith, that is, by faith only.&nbsp; Again,
the law, and the righteousness thereof, flies from them (nor
could they attain it, though they follow after it), because they
sought it not by faith.</p>
<p>Mercy then is to be found alone in Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Again,
the righteousness of the law is to be obtained only by faith of
Jesus Christ; that is, in the Son of God is the righteousness of
the law to be found; for he, by his obedience to his Father, is
become the end of the law for righteousness.&nbsp; And for the
sake of his legal righteousness (which is also called the
righteousness of God, because it was God in the flesh of the Lord
Jesus that did accomplish it), is mercy, and grace from God
extended to whoever dependeth by faith upon God by this Jesus his
righteousness for it.&nbsp; And hence it is, that we so often
read, that this Jesus is the way to the Father; that God, for
Christ&rsquo;s sake, forgiveth us; that by the obedience of one
many are made righteous, or justified; and that through this man
is preached to us the forgiveness of sins; and that by him all
that believe are justified from all things from which they could
not be justified by the law of Moses.</p>
<p>Now, though I here do make mention of righteousness and mercy,
yet I hold there is but one way, to wit, to eternal life; which
way, as I said, is Jesus Christ; for he is the new, the only new
and living way to the Father of mercies, for mercy to make me
capable of abiding with him in the heavens for ever and ever.</p>
<p>But sayst thou, I will be righteous in myself that I may have
wherewith to commend me to God, when I go to him for mercy?</p>
<p>I answer, But thou blind Pharisee, I tell thee thou hast no
understanding of God&rsquo;s design by the gospel, which is, not
to advance man&rsquo;s righteousness, as thou dreamest, but to
advance the righteousness of his Son, and his grace by him.&nbsp;
Indeed, if God&rsquo;s design by the gospel was to exalt and
advance man&rsquo;s righteousness, then that which thou hast said
would be to the purpose; for what greater dignity can be put upon
man&rsquo;s righteousness, than to admit it?</p>
<p>I say then, for God to admit it, to be an advocate, an
intercessor, a mediator; for all these are they which prevail
with God to shew me mercy.&nbsp; But this God never thought of,
much less could he thus design by the gospel; for the text runs
flat against it.&nbsp; Not of works, not of works of
righteousness, which we have done; &ldquo;Not of works, lest any
man should boast,&rdquo; saying, Well, I may thank my own good
life for mercy.&nbsp; It was partly for the sake of my own good
deeds that I obtained mercy to be in heaven and glory.&nbsp;
Shall this be the burden of the song of heaven? or is this that
which is composed by that glittering heavenly host, and which we
have read of in the holy book of God?&nbsp; No, no; that song
runs upon other feet&mdash;standeth in far better strains, being
composed of far higher and truly heavenly matter: for God has
&ldquo;predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus
Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to
the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us
accepted in the Beloved: in whom we have redemption through his
blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his
grace;&rdquo; Eph. i.&nbsp; And it is requisite that the song be
framed accordingly; wherefore he saith, that the heavenly song
runs thus&mdash;&ldquo;Thou art worthy to take the book, and to
open the seals thereof; for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us
to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and
people, and nation; and hast made us unto our God kings and
priests; and we shall reign on the earth;&rdquo; Rev. v. 9,
10.</p>
<p>He saith not that they have redeemed, or helped to redeem and
deliver themselves; but that the Lamb, the Lamb that was slain;
the Lamb only was he that redeemed them.&nbsp; Nor, saith he,
that they had made themselves kings and priests unto God to offer
any oblation, sacrifice, or offering whatsoever, but that the
same Lamb had made them such: for they, as is insinuated by the
text, were in, among, one with, and no better than the kindreds,
tongues, nations, and people of the earth.&nbsp; Better!&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, in no wise,&rdquo; saith Paul (Rom. iii. 9); therefore
their separation from them was of mere mercy, free grace, good
will, and distinguishing love; not for, or because of works of
righteousness which any of them have done; no, they were all
alike.&nbsp; But these, because beloved when in their blood
(according to Ezek. xvi.), were separated by free grace; and as
another scripture hath it, &ldquo;redeemed from the earth,&rdquo;
and from among men by blood; Rev. xiv. 3, 4.&nbsp; Wherefore
deliverance from the ireful wrath of God must not, neither in
whole nor in part, be ascribed to the whole law, or to all the
righteousness that comes by it, but to this Lamb of God, Jesus,
the Saviour of the world; for it is he that delivered us from the
wrath to come, and that according to God&rsquo;s appointment;
&ldquo;for God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain
salvation by (or through) our Lord Jesus Christ;&rdquo; 1 Thess.
i. 10; v. 9.&nbsp; Let every man, therefore, take heed what he
doth, and whereon he layeth the stress of his salvation;
&ldquo;For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid,
which is Jesus Christ;&rdquo; 1 Cor. iii. ii.</p>
<p>But dost thou plead still as thou didst before, and wilt thou
stand thereto?&nbsp; Why then, thy design must overcome God, or
God&rsquo;s design must overcome thee.&nbsp; Thy design is to
give thy good life, thy good deeds, a part of the glory of thy
justification from the curse.&nbsp; And God&rsquo;s design is to
throw all thy righteousness out into the street, into the dirt
and dunghill, as to that thou art for glory, and for glorying
here before God; yea, thou art sharing in the glory of
justification when that alone belongeth to God.&nbsp; And he hath
said, &ldquo;My glory will I not give to another.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Thou wilt not trust wholly to God&rsquo;s grace in Christ for
justification; and God will not take thy stinking righteousness
in as a partner in thy acquitment from sin, death, wrath, and
hell.&nbsp; Now the question is, Who shall prevail?&nbsp; God, or
the Pharisee? and whose word shall stand? his, the
Pharisee&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>Alas! the Pharisee here must needs come down, for God is
greater than all.&nbsp; Also, he hath said, that no flesh shall
glory in his presence; and that he will have mercy, and not
sacrifice.&nbsp; And again, that it is not (or shall be) in him
that wills, nor in him that runs, but in God that sheweth
mercy.&nbsp; What hope, help, stay, or relief, then is there left
for the merit-monger?&nbsp; What twig, or straw, or twined
thread, is left to be a stay for his soul?&nbsp; This besom will
sweep away his cobweb: the house that this spider doth so lean
upon, will now be overturned, and he in it, to hellfire; for
nothing less than everlasting damnation is designed by God, and
that for this fearful and unbelieving Pharisee: God will prevail
against him for ever.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; But wilt thou yet plead thy righteousness for
mercy?&nbsp; Why, in so doing thou takest away from God the power
of giving mercy.&nbsp; For if it be thine as wages, it is no
longer his to dispose of at pleasure; for that which another man
oweth me, is in equity not at his, but at my disposal.&nbsp; Did
I say that by this thy plea thou takest away from God the power
of giving mercy?&nbsp; I will add, yea, and also of disposing of
heaven and life eternal.&nbsp; And then, I pray you, what is left
unto God, and what can he call his own?&nbsp; Not mercy, for that
by thy good deeds thou hast purchased: not heaven, for that by
thy good deeds thou hast purchased: not eternal life, for that by
thy good deeds thou hast purchased.&nbsp; Thus, Pharisee (O thou
self-righteous man), hast thou set up thyself above grace, mercy,
heaven, glory; yea, above even God himself, for the purchaser
should in reason be esteemed above the purchase.</p>
<p>Awake, man!&nbsp; What hast thou done?&nbsp; Thou hast
blasphemed God; thou has undervalued the glory of his grace; thou
hast, what in thee lieth, opposed the glorious design of heaven;
thou hast sought to make thy filthy rags to share in thy
justification.</p>
<p>Now, all these are mighty sins; these have made thine iniquity
infinite.&nbsp; What wilt thou do?&nbsp; Thou hast created to
thyself a world of needless miseries.&nbsp; I call them needless,
because thou hadst more than enough before.&nbsp; Thou hast set
thyself against God in a way of contending, thou standest upon
thy points and pantables; thou wilt not bate God an ace of what
thy righteousness is worth, and wilt also make it worth what
thyself shalt list: thou wilt be thine own judge, as to the worth
of thy righteousness; thou wilt neither hear what verdict the
word has passed about it, nor wilt thou endure that God should
throw it out in the matter of thy justification, but quarrelest
with the doctrine of free grace, or else dost wrest it out of its
place to serve thy Pharisaical designs; saying, &ldquo;God I
thank thee, I am not as other men;&rdquo; fathering upon thyself,
yea, upon God and thyself a stark lie; for thou art as other men
are, though not in this, yet in that; yea, in a far worse
condition than the most of men are.&nbsp; Nor will it help thee
anything to attribute this thy goodness to the God of heaven; for
that is but a mere toying; the truth is, the God that thou
intendest is nothing but thy righteousness; and the grace that
thou supposest is nothing but thine own good and honest
intentions.&nbsp; So that,</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; In all that thou sayst thou dost but play the
downright hypocrite: thou pretendest indeed to mercy, but thou
intendest nothing but merit: thou seemest to give the glory to
God, but at the same time takest it all to thyself: thou
despisest others, and criest up thyself; and in conclusion,
fatherest all upon God by word, and upon thyself in truth.&nbsp;
Nor is there anything more common among this sort of men, than to
make God, his grace, and kindness, the stalking-horse to their
own praise, saying, &ldquo;God, I thank thee,&rdquo; when they
trust to themselves that they are righteous, and have not need of
any repentance; when the truth is, they are the worst sort of men
in the world, because they put themselves into such a state as
God hath not put them into, and then impute it to God, saying,
God, I thank thee, that thou hast done it; for what greater sin
than to make God a liar, or than to father that upon God which he
never meant, intended, or did: and all this under colour to
glorify God, when there is nothing else designed, but to take all
glory from him, and to wear it on thine own head as a crown, and
a diadem, in the face of the whole world.</p>
<p>A self-righteous man, therefore, can come to God for mercy no
otherwise than fawningly: for what need of mercy hath a righteous
man?&nbsp; Let him then talk of mercy, of grace, and goodness,
and come in an hundred times with his, &ldquo;God, I thank
thee,&rdquo; in his mouth, all is but words; there is no sense,
nor savour, nor relish, of mercy and favour; nor doth he in
truth, from his very heart, understand the nature of mercy, nor
what is an object thereof; but when he thanks God, he praises
himself: when he pleads for mercy, he means his own merit; and
all this is manifest from what doth follow; for, saith he, I am
not as this Publican: thence clearly insinuating, that not the
good, but the bad, should be rejected of the God of heaven: that
not the bad but the good, not the sinner, but the self-righteous,
are the most proper objects of God&rsquo;s favour.&nbsp; The same
thing is done by others in this our day: favour, mercy, grace,
and, &ldquo;God, I thank thee,&rdquo; is in their mouths, but
their own strength, sufficiency, free-will, and the like, they
are the things they mean by all such high and glorious
expressions.</p>
<p>But, <i>secondly</i>, If thy plea be not for mercy, but for
justice, then to speak a little to that. 1.&nbsp; Justice has
measures and rules to go by; unto which measures and rules, if
thou comest not up, justice can do thee no good.&nbsp; Come then,
O thou blind Pharisee, let us pass away a few minutes in some
discourse about this.&nbsp; Thou demandest justice, because God
hath said, that the man that doth these things shall live in and
by them.&nbsp; And again, the doers of the law shall be
justified, not in a way of mercy, but in a way of justice:
&ldquo;He shall live by them.&rdquo;&nbsp; But what hast thou
done, O blind Pharisee?&nbsp; What hast thou done, that thou art
emboldened to venture to stand and fall to the most perfect
justice of God?&nbsp; Hast thou fulfilled the whole law, and not
offended in one point?&nbsp; Hast thou purged thyself from the
pollutions and motions of sin that dwell in thy flesh, and work
in thy own members?&nbsp; Is the very being of sin rooted out of
thy tabernacle?&nbsp; And art thou now as perfectly innocent as
ever was Jesus Christ? hast thou, by suffering the uttermost
punishment that justice could justly lay upon thee for thy sins,
made fair and full satisfaction to God, according to the tenor of
his law, for thy transgressions?&nbsp; If thou hast done all
these things, then thou mayst plead something, and yet but
something, for thyself, in a way of justice.&nbsp; Nay, in this I
will assert nothing, but will rather inquire: What hast thou
gained by all this thy righteousness?&nbsp; (We will now suppose
what must not be granted:) Was not this thy state when thou wast
in thy first parents?&nbsp; Wast thou not innocent, perfectly
innocent and righteous?&nbsp; And if thou shouldst be so now,
what hast thou gained thereby?&nbsp; Suppose that the man that
had, forty years ago, forty pounds of his own, and had spent it
all since, should yet be able now to shew his forty pounds again;
what has he got thereby, or how much richer is he at last than he
was when he first set up for himself?&nbsp; Nay, doth not the
blot of his ill living betwixt his first and his last, lie as a
blemish upon him, unless he should redeem himself also, by works
of supererogation, from the scandal that justice may lay at his
door for that.</p>
<p>But, I say, suppose, O Pharisee, this should be thy case, yet
God is not bound to give thee in justice that eternal which by
his grace he bestoweth upon those that have redemption from sin,
by the blood of his Son.&nbsp; Injustice, therefore, when all
comes to all, thou canst require no more than an endless life in
an earthly paradise; for there thou wast set up at first; nor
doth it appear from what hath been said, touching all that thou
hast done or canst do, that thou deservest a better place.</p>
<p>Did I say, that thou mayst require justly an endless life in
an earthly paradise?&nbsp; Why, I must add to that saying this
proviso, If thou continuest in the law, and in the righteousness
thereof; else not.</p>
<p>But how dost thou know that thou shalt continue therein?&nbsp;
Thou hast no promise from God&rsquo;s mouth for that; nor is
grace or strength ministered to mankind by the covenant that thou
art under.&nbsp; So that still thou standest bound to thy good
behaviour; and in the day that thou dost give the first, though
ever so little a trip, or stumble in thy obedience, thou
forfeitest thine interest in paradise (and in justice), as to any
benefit there.</p>
<p>But alas! what need is there that we should thus talk things,
when it is manifest that thou hast sinned, not before thou wast a
Pharisee, but when after the most strictest sect of thy religion
thou livest also a Pharisee; yea, and now in the temple, in thy
prayer there, thou shewest thyself to be full of ignorance,
pride, self-conceit, and horrible arrogancy, and desire of vain
glory, &amp;c., which are none of them the seat or fruits of
righteousness, but the seat of the devil, and the fruit of his
dwelling, even at this time in thy heart.</p>
<p>Could it ever have been imagined, that such audacious
impudence could have put itself forth in any mortal man, in his
approach unto God by prayer, as has shewed itself in thee?&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am not as other men,&rdquo; sayst thou!&nbsp; But is
this the way to go to God in prayer?&nbsp; &ldquo;The prayer of
the upright is God&rsquo;s delight.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the upright
man glorifies God&rsquo;s justice, by confessing to God the
vileness and pollution of his state and condition: he glorifies
God&rsquo;s mercy, by acknowledging, that that, and that only, as
communicated of God by Christ to sinners, can save and deliver
from the curse of the law.</p>
<p>This, I say, is the sum of the prayer of the just and upright
man, Job. i. 8; xl. 4; Acts xiii. 22; Psalm xxxviii.; li.; 2 Sam.
vi. 21, 22; and not as thou most vain-gloriously vauntest with
thy, &ldquo;God, I thank thee, I am not as other men
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>True, when a man is accused by his neighbours, by a brother,
by an enemy, and the like, if he be clear (and he may be so, as
to what they shall lay to his charge), then let him vindicate,
justify, and acquit himself, to the utmost that in justice and
truth he can; for his name, the preservation whereof is more to
be chosen than silver and gold; also his profession, yea, the
name of God too, and religion may now lie at stake, by reason of
such false accusations, and perhaps can by no means (as to this
man) be covered and vindicated from reproach and scandal, but by
his justifying of himself.&nbsp; Wherefore, in such a work, a man
serveth God, and saves religion from hurt; yea, as he that is a
professor, and has his profession attended with a scandalous
life, hurteth religion thereby, so he that has his profession
attended with a good life, and shall suffer it notwithstanding to
lie under blame by false accusations, when it is in the power of
his hand to justify himself, hurteth religion also.&nbsp; But the
case of the Pharisee is otherwise.&nbsp; He is not here a-dealing
with men, but God; not seeking to stand clear in the sight of the
world, but in the sight of heaven itself; and that too, not with
respect to what men or angels, but with respect to what God and
his law could charge him with, and justly lay at his door.</p>
<p>This therefore mainly altereth the case; for a man here to
stand thus upon his point, it is death; for he affronteth God, he
giveth him the lie, he reproveth the law; and, in sum, accuseth
it of bearing false witness against him; he doth this, I say,
even by saying, &ldquo;God, I thank thee, I am not as other men
are;&rdquo; for God hath made none of this difference.&nbsp; The
law condemneth all man as sinners; testifieth that every
imagination of the thought of the heart of the sons of men is
only evil, and that continually; wherefore they that do as the
Pharisee did, to wit, seek to justify themselves before God from
the curse of the law by their own good doings, though they also,
as the Pharisee did, seem to give God the thanks for all; yet do
most horribly sin, even by their so doing, and shall receive a
Pharisee&rsquo;s reward at last.&nbsp; Wherefore, O thou
Pharisee, it is a vain thing for thee either to think of, or to
ask for, at God&rsquo;s hand, either mercy or justice.&nbsp;
Because mercy thou canst not ask for, from sense of want of
mercy, because thy righteousness, which is by the law, hath
utterly blinded thine eyes; and complimenting with God doth
nothing: and as for justice, that can do thee no good; but the
more just God is, and the more by that he acteth towards thee,
the more miserable and fearful will be thy condition, because of
the deficiency of thy so much, by thee, esteemed
righteousness.</p>
<p>What a deplorable condition then is a poor Pharisee in!&nbsp;
For mercy he cannot pray; he cannot pray for it with all his
heart, for he seeth indeed no need thereof.&nbsp; True, the
Pharisee, though he was impudent enough, yet would not take all
from God; he would still count, that there was due to him a
tribute of thanks: &ldquo;God, I thank thee,&rdquo; saith he: but
yet not a bit of this for mercy; but for that he had let him live
(for I know not for what he did thank himself), till he had made
himself better than other men.&nbsp; But that betterment was a
betterment in none other&rsquo;s judgment than that of his own;
and that was none other but such an one as was false.&nbsp; So
then the Pharisee is by this time quite out of doors: his
righteousness is worth nothing, his prayer is worth nothing, his
thanks to God are worth nothing; for that what he had was scanty
and imperfect, and it was his pride that made him offer it to God
for acceptance; nor could his fawning thanksgiving better his
case, or make his matter at all good before God.</p>
<p>But I will warrant you, the Pharisee was so far off from
thinking thus of himself, and of his righteousness, that he
thought of nothing so much as of this, that he was a happy man:
yea, happier by far than other his fellow rationals: yea, he
plainly declares it, when he saith, &ldquo;God, I thank thee, I
am not as other men are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>O what a fool&rsquo;s paradise was the heart of the Pharisee
now in, while he stood in the temple praying to God!&nbsp; God, I
thank thee, said he; for I am good and holy; I am a righteous
man; I have been full of good works; I am no extortioner, unjust,
nor adulterer, nor yet as this wretched Publican.&nbsp; I have
kept myself strictly to the rule of mine order, and my order is
the most strict of all orders now in being: I fast, I pray, I
give tithes of all that I possess.&nbsp; Yea, so forward am I to
be a religious man, so ready have I been to listen after my duty,
that I have asked both of God and man the ordinances of judgment
and justice; I take delight in approaching to God.&nbsp; What
less now can be mine than the heavenly kingdom and glory?</p>
<p>Now the Pharisee, like Haman, saith in his heart, To whom
would the king delight to do honour more than to myself?&nbsp;
Where is the man that so pleaseth God, and, consequently, that in
equity and reason should be beloved of God like me?&nbsp; Thus
like the prodigal&rsquo;s brother, he pleadeth, saying,
&ldquo;Lo, these many years do I serve thee; neither transgressed
I at any time thy commandments,&rdquo; Luke xv. 29.&nbsp; O brave
Pharisee! but go on in thine oration&mdash;&ldquo;Nor yet as this
Publican.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor wretch, quoth the Pharisee to the Publican, What comest
thou for?&nbsp; Dost think that such a sinner as thou art shall
be heard of God?&nbsp; God heareth not sinners; but if any man be
a worshipper of God (as I am, as I thank God I am), him he
heareth.&nbsp; Thou, for thy part, hast been a rebel all thy
days: I abhor to come nigh thee, or to touch thy garments.&nbsp;
Stand by thyself, come not near me, for I am more holy than thou;
Isa. lxv. 5.</p>
<p>Hold, stop there, go no further: fie, Pharisee, fie! dost thou
know before whom thou standest, to whom thou speakest, and of
what the matter of thy silly oration is made?&nbsp; Thou art now
before God, thou speakest now to God, and therefore in justice
and honesty thou shouldst make mention of his righteousness, not
of thine; of his righteousness, and of his only.</p>
<p>I am sure Abraham, of whom thou sayst he is thy father, never
had the face to do as thou hast done, though, it is to be
presumed, he had more cause so to do than thou hast, or canst
have.&nbsp; Abraham had whereof to glory, but not before God;
yea, he was called God&rsquo;s friend, and yet would not glory
before him; but humbleth himself, was afraid, and trembled in
himself, when he stood before him acknowledging of himself to be
but dust and ashes; Gen. xviii. 27, 30, 22; Rom. iv. 1, 2; but
thou, as thou hadst quite forgot that thou wast framed of that
matter, and after the manner of other men, standest and pleadest
thy goodness before him?&nbsp; Be ashamed, Pharisee! dost thou
think that God hath eyes of flesh, or that he seeth as man
sees?&nbsp; Are not the secrets of thy heart open unto him
Thinkest thou with thyself that thou, with a few of thy defiled
ways, canst cover thy rotten wall, that thou has daubed with
untempered mortar, and so hide the dirt thereof from his eyes; or
that these fine, smooth, and oily words, that come out of thy
mouth, will make him forget that thy throat is an open sepulchre,
and that thou within art full of dead men&rsquo;s bones, and all
uncleanness?&nbsp; Thy thus cleansing of the outside of the cup
and platter, and thy garnishing of the sepulchres of the
righteous, is nothing at all in God&rsquo;s eyes, but things that
manifest that thou art an hypocrite and blind, because thou
takest no notice of that which is within, which yet is that which
is most abominable to God.&nbsp; For the fruit, alas! what is the
fruit of the tree, or what are the streams of the fountain?&nbsp;
Thy fountain is defiled; yea, a defiler, and so that which maketh
the whole self, with thy works, unclean in God&rsquo;s sight.</p>
<p>But, Pharisee, how comes it to pass that the poor Publican is
now so much a mote in thine eye, that thou canst not forbear, but
must accuse him before the judgment-seat of God&mdash;for in that
thou sayst, that thou art not even as this Publican, thou
bringest in an accusation, a charge, a bill, against him?&nbsp;
What has he done?&nbsp; Has he concealed any of thy
righteousness? or has he secretly informed against thee, that
thou art an hypocrite and superstitious?&nbsp; I dare say, the
poor wretch has neither meddled nor made with thee in these
matters.</p>
<p>But what aileth thee, Pharisee?&nbsp; Doth the poor Publican
stand to vex thee?&nbsp; Doth he touch thee with his dirty
garments? or doth he annoy thee with his stinking breath?&nbsp;
Doth his posture of standing so like a man condemned offend
thee?&nbsp; True, he now standeth with his hand held up at
God&rsquo;s bar; he pleads guilty to all that is laid to his
charge.</p>
<p>He cannot strut, vapour, and swagger as thou dost; but why
offended at this?&nbsp; Oh, but he has been a naughty man, and I
have been righteous! sayst thou.&nbsp; Well, Pharisee, well, his
naughtiness shall not be laid to thy charge, if thou hast chosen
none of his ways.&nbsp; But since thou wilt yet bear me down that
thou art righteous, shew now, even now, while thou standest
before God with the Publican, some, though they be but small,
yea, though but very small, fruits of thy righteousness.&nbsp;
Let the Publican alone, since he is speaking for his life before
God.&nbsp; Or, if thou canst not let him alone, yet do not speak
against him; for thy so doing will but prove that thou
rememberest the evil that the man has done unto thee; yea, and
that thou bearest him a grudge for it too, and while you stand
before God.</p>
<p>But, Pharisee, the righteous man is a merciful man, and while
he standeth praying, he forgiveth; yea, and also crieth to God
that he will forgive him too; Mark xi. 25, 26; Acts vii.
60.&nbsp; Hitherto then thou hast shewed none of the fruits of
thy righteousness.&nbsp; Pharisee, righteousness would teach thee
to love this Publican, but thou shewest that thou hatest
him.&nbsp; Love covereth the multitude of sins; but hatred and
unfaithfulness revealeth secrets.</p>
<p>Pharisee, thou shouldst have remembered this thy brother in
this his day of adversity, and shouldst have shewed that thou
hadst compassion on thy brother in this his deplorable condition;
but thou, like the proud, the cruel, and the arrogant man, hast
taken thy neighbour at the advantage, and that when he is even
between the straits, and standing upon the pinnacle of
difficulty, betwixt the heavens and the hells, and hast done what
thou couldst, what on thy part lay, to thrust him down to the
deep, saying, &ldquo;I am not even as this Publican.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What cruelty can be greater, what rage more furious, and what
spite and hatred more damnable and implacable, than to follow, or
take a man while he is asking of mercy at God&rsquo;s hands, and
to put in a caveat against his obtaining of it, by exclaiming
against him that he is a sinner?&nbsp; The master of
righteousness doth not so: &ldquo;Do not think (saith he) that I
will accuse you to the Father.&rdquo;&nbsp; The scholars of
righteousness do not do so.&nbsp; &ldquo;But as for me (said
David), when they (mine enemies) were sick (and the Publican here
was sick of the most malignant disease), my clothing was of
sackcloth, I humbled my soul with fasting, and my prayer (to wit,
that I made for them) returned into mine own bosom.&nbsp; I
behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I
bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother;&rdquo;
John v. 45; Psalm xxxv. 13, 14.</p>
<p>Pharisee, dost thou see here how contrary thou art to
righteous men?&nbsp; Now then, where shall we find out one to
parallel thee, but by finding him out that is called &ldquo;the
dragon;&rdquo; for he it is that accuseth the poor sinners before
God?&nbsp; Zech. iii.; Rev. xii.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not as this Publican.&rdquo;&nbsp; Modesty should
have commanded thee to have bit thy tongue as to this.&nbsp; What
could the angels think, but that revenge was now in thine heart,
and but that thou comest up into the temple rather to boast of
thyself and accuse thy neighbour, than to pray to the God of
heaven; for what petition is there in all thy prayer, that gives
the least intimation that thou hast the knowledge of God or
thyself?&nbsp; Nay, what petition of any kind is there in thy
vain-glorious oration from first to last?&nbsp; Only an
accusation drawn up, and that against one helpless and forlorn;
against a poor man, because he is a sinner; drawn up, I say,
against him by thee, who canst not make proof of thyself that
thou art righteous; but come to proofs of righteousness, and thou
art wanting also.&nbsp; What, though thy raiment is better than
his, thy skin may be full as black; yea, what if thy skin be
whiter than his, thy heart may be yet far blacker.&nbsp; Yea, it
is so, for the truth hath spoken it; for within, you are full of
excess and all uncleanness; Matt. xxiii.</p>
<p>Pharisee, these are transgressions against the second table,
and the Publican shall be guilty of them; but there are sins also
against the first table, and thou thyself art guilty of them.</p>
<p>The Publican, in that he was an extortioner, unjust and an
adulterer, made it thereby manifest that he did not love his
neighbour; and thou by making a god, a saviour, a deliverer, of
thy filthy righteousness, dost make it appear, that thou dost not
love thy God; for as he that taketh, or that derogateth from his
neighbour in that which is his neighbour&rsquo;s due, sinneth
against his neighbour; so he that taketh or derogateth from God,
sinneth against God.</p>
<p>Now, then, though thou hast not, as thou dost imagine, played
at that low game as to derogate from thy neighbour; yet thou hast
played at that high game as to derogate from thy God; for thou
hast robbed God of the glory of salvation; yea, declared, that as
to that there is no trust to be put in him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lo, this
is the man that made not God his strength; but trusted in the
abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his
wickedness;&rdquo; Psalm lii. 7.</p>
<p>What else means this great bundle of thy own righteousness,
which thou hast brought with thee into the temple? yea, what
means else thy commending of thyself because of that, and so thy
implicit prayer, that thou for that mightst find acceptance with
God?</p>
<p>All this, what does it argue, I say, but thy diffidence of
God? and that thou countest salvation safer in thine own
righteousness than in the righteousness of God? and that thy own
love to, and care of thy own soul, is far greater, and so much
better, than is the care and love of God?&nbsp; And is this to
keep the first table; yea, the first branch of that table, which
saith, &ldquo;Thou shalt love the Lord thy God?&rdquo; for thy
thus doing cannot stand with love to God?</p>
<p>How can that man say, I love God, who from his very heart
shrinketh to trust in him?&nbsp; Or, how can that man say, I
would glorify God, who in his very heart refuseth to stand and
fall by his mercy?</p>
<p>Suppose a great man should bid all the poor of the parish to
his house to dinner, and should moreover send by the mouth of his
servant, saying, My lord hath killed his fatlings, hath furnished
his table, and prepared his wine, nor is there want of anything;
come to the banquet: Would it not be counted as an high affront
to, great contempt of, and much distrust in, the goodness of the
man of the house, if some of these guests should take with them,
out of their own poor store, some of their mouldy crusts, and
carry them with them, lay them on their trenchers upon the table
before the lord of the feast and the rest of his guests, out of
fear that he yet would not provide sufficiently for those he had
bidden to the dinner that he had made?</p>
<p>Why, Pharisee, this is the very case; thou hast been called to
a banquet, even to the banquet of God&rsquo;s grace, and thou
hast been disposed to go; but behold, thou hast not believed that
he would of his own cost make thee a feast when thou comest:
wherefore of thy own store thou hast brought with thee, and hast
laid upon thy trencher on his table thy mouldy crusts in the
presence of the angels, and of this poor Publican; yea, and hast
vauntingly said upon the whole, &ldquo;God, I thank thee, I am
not as other men are.&rdquo;&nbsp; I am no such needy man; Luke
xviii. 11.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am no extortioner, nor unjust, nor
adulterer, nor even as this Publican.&rdquo;&nbsp; I am come
indeed to thy feast, for of civility I could do no less; but for
thy dainties, I need them not, I have of such things enough of
mine own; Luke xviii. 12.&nbsp; I thank thee therefore for thy
offer of kindness, but I am not as those that have, and stand in
need thereof, &ldquo;nor yet as this Publican.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
thus feeding upon thine own fare, or by making a composition of
his and thine together, thou contemnest God, thou countest him
insufficient or unfaithful; that is, either one that has not
enough, or having it, will not bestow it upon the poor and needy;
and, therefore, of mere pretence thou goest to his banquet, but
yet trustest to thy own, and to that only.</p>
<p>This is to break the first table; and so to make thyself a
sinner of the highest form: for the sins against the first table
are sins of an higher nature than are the sins against the
second.&nbsp; True, the sins of the second table are also sins
against God, because they are sins against the commandments of
God: but the sins that are against the first table, are sins not
only against the command, but against the very love, strength,
holiness, and faithfulness of God: and herein stands thy
condition; thou hast not, thou sayst, thou hast not done injury
to thy neighbour; but what of that, if thou hast reproached thy
maker?</p>
<p>Pharisee, I will assure thee, thou art beside the saddle; thy
state is not good, thy righteousness is so far off from doing any
good, that it maketh thee to be a greater sinner, because it
signifieth more immediately against the mercy, the love, the
grace, and goodness of God, than the sins of other sinners, as to
degree, do.</p>
<p>And as they are more odious and abominable in the sight of God
(as they needs must, if what is said be true, as it is), so they
are more dangerous to the life and soul of man; for that they
always appear unto him in whom they dwell, and to him that
trusteth in them, not to be sins and transgressions, but virtues
and excellent things; not things that set a man further off, but
the things that bring a man nearer God, than those that want them
are or can be.</p>
<p>This therefore is the dangerous estate of those that go about
to establish their own righteousness, that neither have, nor can,
while they are so doing, submit themselves to the righteousness
of God; Rom. x. 3.&nbsp; It is far more easy to persuade a poor
wretch, whose life is debauched, and sins are written in his
forehead, to submit to the righteousness of God (that is, to the
righteousness that is of God&rsquo;s providing and giving), than
it is to persuade a self-righteous man to do it; for the profane
is sooner convinced of the necessity of righteousness to save
him, as that he has none of his own, and accepteth of, and
submitteth himself to the help and salvation that is in the
righteousness and obedience of another.</p>
<p>And upon this account it is that Christ saith the publicans
and harlots enter into the kingdom of heaven before the scribes
and Pharisees; Matt. xxi. 31.&nbsp; Poor Pharisee, what a loss
art thou at? thou art not only a sinner, but a sinner of the
highest form.&nbsp; Not a sinner by such sins (by such sins
chiefly) as the second table doth make manifest; but a sinner
chiefly in that way as no self-righteous man did ever dream
of.&nbsp; For when the righteous man or Pharisee shall hear that
he is a sinner, he replieth, &ldquo;I am not as other men
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And because the common and more ordinary description of sin is
the transgression against the second table, he presently replieth
again, &ldquo;I am not as this Publican is;&rdquo; and so
shroudeth himself under his own lame endeavours and ragged
partial patches of moral or civil righteousness.&nbsp; Wherefore,
when he heareth that his righteousness is condemned, slighted,
and accounted nothing worth, then he fretteth and fumeth, and
would kill the man that so slighteth and disdaineth his goodly
righteousness; but Christ, and the true gospel-teacher still go
on, and condemn all his righteousness as menstruous rags, as an
abomination to God, and nothing but loss and dung.</p>
<p>Now menstruous rags, things that are an abomination and dung,
are not fit matter to make a garment of to wear when I come to
God for life, much less to be made my friend, my advocate, my
mediator and spokesman, when I stand betwixt heaven and hell;
Isa. lxiv. 6; Luke xvi. 15; Phil. iii. 6&ndash;8, to plead for me
that I might be saved.</p>
<p>Perhaps some will blame me, and count me also worthy thereof,
because I do not distinguish betwixt the matter and the manner of
the Pharisee&rsquo;s righteousness.&nbsp; And let them condemn me
still for saving the holy law, which is neither the matter nor
manner of the Pharisee&rsquo;s righteousness, but rather the
rules (if he will live thereby) up to which he should completely
come in every thing that he doth.&nbsp; And I say again, that the
whole of the Pharisee&rsquo;s righteousness is sinful, though not
with and to men, yet with and before the God of heaven.&nbsp;
Sinful, I say it is, and abominable, both in itself, and also in
its effects.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; In itself; for that it is imperfect, scanty, and
short of the rule by which righteousness is enjoined, and even
with which every act should be; for shortness here, even every
shortness in these duties, is sin and sinful weakness; wherefore
the curse taketh hold of the man for coming short; but that it
could not justly do, if his coming short was not his sin: Cursed
is every one that doth not, and that continueth not to do all
things written in the law; Deut. xxvii. 26; Gal. iii. 10.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; It is sinful; because it is wrought by sinful flesh;
for all legal righteousness is a work of the flesh; Rom. iv. 1,
&amp;c.; Phil. iii. 3&ndash;8.</p>
<p>A work, I say, of the flesh; even of that flesh, who, or which
also committeth the greatest enormities; for the flesh is but
one, though its workings are divers: sometimes in a way most
notoriously sensual and devilish, causing the soul to wallow in
the mire.</p>
<p>But these are not all the works of the flesh; the flesh
sometimes will attempt to be righteous, and set upon doing
actions that in their perfection would be very glorious and
beautiful to behold.&nbsp; But because the law is only commanding
words, and yieldeth no help to the man that attempts to perform
it; and because the flesh is weak, and cannot do of itself that,
therefore this most glorious work of the flesh faileth.</p>
<p>But, I say, as it is a work of the flesh it cannot be good,
forasmuch as the hand that worketh it is defiled with sin; for in
a good man, one spiritually good, that is &ldquo;in his flesh,
there dwells no good thing,&rdquo; but consequently that which is
bad; how then can the flesh of a carnal, graceless man (and such
a one is every Pharisee and self-righteous man in the world),
produce, though it joineth itself to the law, to the righteous
law of God, that which is good in his sight.</p>
<p>If any shall think that I pinch too hard, because I call
man&rsquo;s righteousness which is of the law, of the righteous
law of God, flesh, let them consider that which follows: to wit,
That though man by sin is said &ldquo;to be dead in sin and
trespasses,&rdquo; yet not so dead but that he can act still in
his own sphere; that is, to do, and choose to do, either that
which by all men is counted base, or that which by some is
counted good, though he is not, nor can all the world make him,
capable of doing any thing that may please his God.</p>
<p>Man, by nature, as dead as he is, can, and that with the will
of his flesh, will his own salvation.&nbsp; Man, by nature, can,
and that by the power of the flesh, pursue and follow after his
own salvation; but then he wills it, and pursues or follows after
it, not in God&rsquo;s way, but his own; not by faith in Christ,
but by the law of Moses.&nbsp; See Rom. ix. 16, 31; x. 3, 7.</p>
<p>Wherefore it is no error to say, that a man naturally has
will, and a power to pursue his will, and that as to his own
salvation.&nbsp; But it is a damnable error to say, that he hath
will and power to pursue it, and that in God&rsquo;s way: for
then we must hold that the mysteries of the gospel are natural;
for that natural men, or men by nature, may apprehend and know
them, yea, and know them to be the only means by which they must
obtain eternal life; for the understanding must act before the
will; yea, a man must approve of the way to life by Jesus Christ,
before his mind will budge, or stir, or move, that way:
&ldquo;But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit
of God (of the gospel); for they are foolishness to him; neither
can he know them, because they are spiritually
discerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He receiveth not these things; that is, his mind and will lie
cross unto them, for he counts them foolishness; nor can all the
natural wisdom in the world cause that his will should fall in
with them, because it cannot discern them.</p>
<p>Nature discerneth the law, and the righteousness thereof; yea,
it discerneth it, and approveth thereof; that is, that the
righteousness of it is the best and only way to life, and
therefore the natural will and power of the flesh, as here you
see in the Pharisee, do steer their course by that to eternal
life; 1 Cor. ii. 14.</p>
<p>The righteousness of the law, therefore, is a work of the
flesh, a work of sinful flesh, and therefore must needs be as
filth, and dung, and abominable as to that for which this man
hath produced it and presented it in the temple before God.</p>
<p>Nor is the Pharisee alone entangled in this mischief; many
souls are by these works of the flesh flattered, as also the
Pharisee was, into an opinion, that their state is good, when
there is nothing in it.&nbsp; The most that their conversion
amounteth to is, the Publican is become a Pharisee; the open
sinner is become a self-righteous man.&nbsp; Of the black side of
the flesh he hath had enough, now therefore with the white side
of the flesh he will recreate himself.&nbsp; And now, most wicked
must he needs be that questioneth the goodness of the state of
such a man.&nbsp; He, of a drunkard, a swearer, an unclean
person, a Sabbath-breaker, a liar, and the like, is become
reformed, a lover of righteousness, a strict observer, doer, and
trader in the formalities of the law, and a herder with men of
his complexion.&nbsp; And now he is become a great exclaimer
against sin and sinners, denying to be acquaint with those that
once were his companions, saying, &ldquo;I am not even as this
Publican.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To turn therefore from sin to man&rsquo;s righteousness, yea,
to rejoice in confidence, that thy state is better than is that
of the Publican (I mean, better in the eyes of divine justice,
and in the judgment of the law); and yet to be found by the law,
not in the spirit, but in the flesh; not in Christ, but under the
law; not in a state of salvation, but of damnation, is common
among men: for they, and they only, are the right men, &ldquo;who
worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have
no confidence in the flesh.&rdquo;&nbsp; Where, by
&ldquo;flesh,&rdquo; must not be meant the horrible
transgressions against the law (though they are also called
&ldquo;the works of the flesh,&rdquo; Gal. iv. 29); for they
minister no occasion unto men to have confidence in them towards
God: but that is that which is insinuated by Paul, where he
saith, he had no &ldquo;confidence in the flesh,&rdquo; though he
might have had it; as he said, &ldquo;though I might also have
confidence in the flesh.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If any other
man,&rdquo; saith he, &ldquo;thinketh that he hath whereof he
might trust in the flesh, I more,&rdquo; Phil. iii. 3, 4; and
then he repeats a twofold privilege that he had by the flesh.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; That he was one of the seed of Abraham, and of the
tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews, &amp;c.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; That he had fallen in with the strictest men of that
religion, which was such after the flesh, to wit, to be a
Pharisee, and was the son of a Pharisee, had much fleshly zeal
for God, and &ldquo;touching the righteousness which is of the
law, blameless,&rdquo; Phil. iii. 3, 5, 6.</p>
<p>But I say still, there is nothing but flesh; fleshly
privileges and fleshly righteousness, and so, consequently, a
fleshly confidence, and trust for heaven.&nbsp; This is manifest;
when the man had his eyes enlightened, he counted all loss and
dung that he might be found in Christ, not having his own
righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the
faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.</p>
<p>And this leads me to another thing, and that is, to tell thee,
O thou blind Pharisee, that thou canst not be in a safe
condition, because thou hast thy confidence in the flesh, that
is, in the righteousness of the flesh.&nbsp; &ldquo;For all flesh
is grass, and all the glory of it as the flower of the
field;&rdquo; and the flesh, and the glory of that being as weak
as the grass, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the
oven, is but a weak business for a man to venture his eternal
salvation upon.&nbsp; Wherefore, as I also hinted before, the
godly-wise have been afraid to be found in their righteousness, I
mean their own personal righteousness, though that is far better
than can be the righteousness of any carnal man: for the godly
man&rsquo;s righteousness is wrought by the Spirit and faith of
Christ, but the ungodly man&rsquo;s righteousness is of the
flesh, and of the law.&nbsp; Yet I say, this godly man is afraid
to stand by his righteousness before the tribunal of God, as is
manifest in these following particulars.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; He sees sin in his righteousness; for so the prophet
intimates, when he saith, &ldquo;All our righteousnesses are as
filthy rags&rdquo; (Isa. lxiv.); but there is nothing can make
one&rsquo;s righteousness filthy but sin.&nbsp; It is not the
poor, the low, the mean, the sickly, the beggarly state of man,
nor yet his being hated of devils, persecuted of men, broken
under necessities, reproaches, distresses, or any kind of
troubles of this nature that can make the godly man&rsquo;s
righteousness filthy; nothing but sin can do it, and that can,
doth, hath, and will do it.&nbsp; Nor can any man, be he who he
will, and though he watches, prays, strives, denies himself, and
puts his body under what chastisement or hardships he can; yea,
though he also get his spirit and soul hoisted up to the highest
peg or pin of sanctity and holy contemplation, and so his lusts
to the greatest degree of mortification; but sin will be with him
in the best of his performances: with him, I say, to pollute and
defile his duties, and to make his righteousness speckled and
spotted, filthy and menstruous.</p>
<p>I will give you two or three instances for this.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; Nehemiah was a man (in his day), one that was
zealous, very zealous, for God, for his house, for his people,
and for his ways; and so continued, and that from first to last,
as they may see that please to read the relation of his actions;
yet when he comes seriously to be concerned with God about his
duties, he relinquisheth a standing by them.&nbsp; True, he
mentioneth them to God, but confesseth that there are
imperfections in them, and prayeth that God will not wipe them
away.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wipe not out my good deeds, O my God, that I
have done for the house of my God, and for the offices
thereof.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again, &ldquo;Remember me, O my God,
concerning this also (another good deed), and spare me according
to the greatness of thy mercy; and remember me, O my God, for
good;&rdquo; Neh. xiii.</p>
<p>I do not think that by these prayers he pleadeth for an
acceptance of his person, as touching justification from the
curse of the law (as the poor blind Pharisee doth), but that God
would accept of his service, as he was a son, and not deny to
give him a reward of grace for what he had done, since he was
pleased to declare in his testament, that he would reward the
labour of love of his saints with an exceeding weight of glory;
and therefore prayeth, that God would not wipe away his good
deeds, but remember him for good, according to the greatness of
his mercy.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; A second instance is that of David, where he saith,
&ldquo;Enter not into judgment with thy servant, O Lord; for in
thy sight shall no man living be justified;&rdquo; Psalm clxiii.
2.&nbsp; David, as I have hinted before, is said to be a man
&ldquo;after God&rsquo;s own heart,&rdquo; Acts xiii.; and as
here by the Spirit he acknowledges him for his servant; yet
behold how he shrinketh, how he draweth back, how he prayeth, and
petitioneth, that God would vouchsafe so much as not to enter
into judgment with him.&nbsp; Lord, saith he, if thou enterest
into judgment with me, I die, because I shall be condemned; for
in thy sight I cannot be justified; to wit, by my own good
deeds.&nbsp; Lord, at the beginning of thy dealing with me, by
the law and my works, I die: therefore do not so much as enter
into judgment with me, O Lord.&nbsp; Nor is this my case only,
but it is the condition of all the world: &ldquo;For in thy sight
shall no man living be justified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; A third instance is that general conclusion of the
apostle, &ldquo;But that no man is justified by the law in the
sight of God is evident; for the just shall live by
faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; By this saying of St Paul, as he taketh up
the sentence of the prophet Habakkuk, chap. ii. 4, so he taketh
up this sentence, yea, and the personal justice of David
also.&nbsp; No man, saith he, is justified by the law in the
sight of God: no, no just man, no holy man, not the strictest and
most righteous man.&nbsp; But why not?&nbsp; Why, because
&ldquo;the just shall live by faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The just man, therefore, must die, if he has not faith in
another righteousness than that which is of the law, called his
own: I say, he must die, if he has none other righteousness than
that which is his own by the law.&nbsp; Thus also Paul confesses
of himself: &ldquo;I (saith he) know nothing by myself,&rdquo;
either before conversion or after; that is, I knew not that I did
any thing before conversion, either against the law, or against
my conscience; for I was then, touching the righteousness which
is of the law, blameless.&nbsp; Also, since my conversion, I know
nothing by myself; for &ldquo;I have walked in all good
conscience before God unto this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A great saying, I promise you.&nbsp; Well, but yet &ldquo;I am
not hereby justified;&rdquo; Phil. iii. 7; Acts xxiii. 1; 1 Cor.
iv. 4.&nbsp; Nor will I dare to venture the eternal salvation of
my soul upon mine own justice; &ldquo;for he that judgeth me is
the Lord;&rdquo; that is, though I, through my dim-sightedness,
cannot see the imperfections of my righteousness, yet the Lord,
who is my judge, and before whose tribunal I must shortly stand,
can and will; and if in his sight there shall be found no more
but one spot in my righteousness, I must, if I plead my
righteousness, fall for that.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; That the best of men are afraid to stand before
God&rsquo;s tribunal, there to be judged by the law as to life
and death, according to the sufficiency or non-sufficiency of
their righteousness, is evident; because by casting away their
own (in this matter), they make all the means they can for this;
that is, that his mercy, by an act of grace, be made over to
them, and that they in it may stand before God to be judged.</p>
<p>Hence David cries out so often, &ldquo;Lead me in thy
righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Deliver me in thy
righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Judge me according to thy
righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Quicken me in thy
righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;O Lord (says he), give ear to
my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy
righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And enter not into judgment
with thy servant, O Lord: for in thy sight shall no flesh living
be justified.&rdquo;&nbsp; And David, what if God doth
thus?&nbsp; Why, then, saith he, &ldquo;My tongue shall speak of
his righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My tongue shall sing of
thy righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My mouth shall shew forth
thy righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yea, I will make mention
of thy righteousness, even of thine only;&rdquo; Psalm lviii.;
xxxi. 1; xxxv. 24; cxix. 40; xxxv. 28; li. 14; lxxi. 15, 16.</p>
<p>Daniel also, when he comes to plead for himself and his
people, he first casts away his and their righteousness, saying,
&ldquo;For we do not present our supplications unto thee for our
righteousness:&rdquo;&nbsp; And he pleads God&rsquo;s
righteousness, and that he might have a share and interest in
that saying, &ldquo;O Lord, righteousness belongeth to
thee;&rdquo; to wit, that righteousness, for the sake of which,
mercy and forgiveness, and so heaven and happiness, is extended
to us.</p>
<p>Righteousness belongeth to thee, and is thine, as nearly as
sin, shame, and confusion, are ours, and belongeth to us.&nbsp;
Read the 16th and 17th verses of the 9th of Daniel.&nbsp;
&ldquo;O Lord (saith he), according to all thy righteousness, I
beseech thee, let thine anger, and thy fury, be turned away from
thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain; because for our sins, and
for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem, and thy people, are
become a reproach to all that are about us.&nbsp; Now, therefore,
O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications,
and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate,
for the Lord&rsquo;s sake:&rdquo;&nbsp; For the sake of the Lord
Jesus Christ; for on him Daniel now had his eye, and through him
to the Father he made his supplication; yea, and the answer was
according to his prayer, to wit, that God would have mercy on
Jerusalem; and that he would in his time send the Lord, the
Messias, to bring them in everlasting righteousness for them.</p>
<p>Paul also, as I have hinted before, disclaims his own
righteousness, and layeth fast hold on the righteousness of God;
seeking to be found in that, not having his own righteousness,
for he knew that when the rain descends, the winds blow, and the
floods come down on all men, they that have but their own
righteousness, must fall; Phil. iii</p>
<p>Now, the earnest desire of the righteous to be found in
God&rsquo;s righteousness, ariseth from strong conviction of the
imperfections of their own, and the knowledge that was given them
of the terror that will attend men at the day of the fiery trial;
to wit, the day of judgement.&nbsp; For although men can now
flatter themselves into a fool&rsquo;s paradise, and persuade
themselves that all shall be well with them then, for the sake of
their own silly and vain-glorious performances, yet when the day
comes that shall burn like an oven, and when all that have done
wickedly shall be as stubble (and so will all appear to be that
are not found in Christ), then will their righteousness vanish
like smoke, or be like fuel for that burning flame.&nbsp; And
hence the righteousness that the godly seek to be found in, is
called, The name of the Lord, a strong tower, a rock, a shield, a
fortress, a buckler, a rock of defence, unto which they resort,
and into which they run and are safe.</p>
<p>The godly therefore do not, as this Pharisee, bring their own
righteousness into the temple, and there buoy up themselves and
spirits by that into a conceit, that for the sake of that God
will be merciful and good unto them; but throwing away their own,
they make to God for his, because they certainly know, even by
the word of God, that in the judgment none can stand the trial
but those that are found in the righteousness of God.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; That the best of men are afraid to stand before
God&rsquo;s tribunal by the law, there to be judged to life and
death, according to the sufficiency or non-sufficiency of their
righteousness, is evident; for they know, that it is a vain thing
to seek, by acts of righteousness, to make themselves righteous
men, as is the way of all them that seek to be justified by the
deeds of the law.</p>
<p>And herein lieth the great difference between the Pharisee and
the true Christian man.&nbsp; The Pharisee thinks, by acts of
righteousness, he shall make himself a righteous man: therefore
he cometh into the presence of God well furnished, as he thinks,
with his negative and positive righteousness.</p>
<p>Grace suffereth not a man to boast before God, whatever he
saith before men.&nbsp; His soul that is lifted up, is not
upright in him; and better is the poor in spirit than the proud
in spirit.&nbsp; The Pharisee was a very proud man; a proud,
ignorant man; proud of his own righteousness, and ignorant of
God&rsquo;s: for had he not, he could not, as he did, have so
condemned the Publican, and justified himself.</p>
<p>And I say again, that all this pride and vain-glorious show of
the Pharisee did arise from his not being acquainted with this,
that a man must be good before he can do good; he must be
righteous, before he can do righteousness.&nbsp; This is evident
from Paul, who insinuateth this as the reason why none do good,
even because &ldquo;There is none that is righteous, no, not
one.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There is none righteous,&rdquo; saith
he, and then follows, &ldquo;There is none that doeth
good;&rdquo; Rom. iii. 10, 11, 12.&nbsp; For it is not possible
for a man that is not first made righteous by the God of heaven,
to do any thing that in a gospel-sense may be called
righteousness.&nbsp; To make himself a righteous man, by his so
meddling with them, he may design; but work righteousness, and so
by such works of righteousness make himself a righteous man, he
cannot.</p>
<p>The righteousness of a carnal man is indeed by God called
righteousness; but it must be understood as spoken in the dialect
of the world.&nbsp; The world indeed calls it righteousness, and
it will do no harm, if it bear that term with reference to
worldly matters.&nbsp; Hence worldly civilians are called good
and righteous men, and so, such as Christ, under that notion,
neither died for, nor giveth his grace unto; Rom. v. 7, 8.&nbsp;
But we are not now discoursing about any other righteousness,
than that which is so accounted either in a law or in a
gospel-sense; and therefore let us a little more touch upon
that.</p>
<p>A man then must be righteous in a law-sense, before he can do
acts of righteousness, I mean, that are such in a
gospel-sense.&nbsp; Hence, first, you have true
gospel-righteousness made the fruit of a second birth.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If ye know that Christ is righteous, know ye that every
one that doeth righteousness is born of him;&rdquo; 1 John ii.
29.&nbsp; Not born of him by virtue of his own righteous actions,
but born of him by virtue of Christ&rsquo;s mighty working with
his work upon the soul, who afterwards, from a principle of life,
acteth and worketh righteousness.</p>
<p>And he saith again, &ldquo;Little children, let no man deceive
you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is
righteous.&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon this scripture I will a little
comment, for the proof of what is urged before: namely, that a
man must be righteous in a law-sense, before he can do such
things that may be called acts of righteousness in a
gospel-sense.&nbsp; And for this, this scripture, 1 John iii. 7,
ministereth to us two things to be considered by us.</p>
<p>The first is, That he that doth righteousness is
righteous.</p>
<p>The second is, That he that doth righteousness is righteous,
as Christ is righteous.</p>
<p><i>First</i>, He that doth righteousness; that is,
righteousness which the gospel calleth so, is righteous; that is,
precedent to, or before he doth that righteousness.&nbsp; For he
doth not say, he shall make his person righteous by acts of
righteousness that he shall do; for then an evil tree may bear
good fruit, yea, and may make itself good by doing so; but he
saith, He that doth righteousness is righteous; as he saith, He
that doth righteousness is born of him.</p>
<p>So then, a man must be righteous before he can do
righteousness, before he can do righteousness in a
gospel-sense.</p>
<p>Our second thing then is to inquire, with what righteousness a
man must be righteous, before he can do that which in a
gospel-sense is called righteousness.</p>
<p>And, first, I answer, he must be righteous in a law-sense:
that is, he must be righteous in the judgment of the law.&nbsp;
This is evident: because he saith, &ldquo;He that doeth
righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.&rdquo;&nbsp; That
is, in a law-sense: for Christ in no sense is righteous in the
judgment of charity only; but in his meanest acts, if it be
lawful to make such comparison, he was righteous in a law-sense,
or in the judgment of the law.&nbsp; Now the apostle saith, that
&ldquo;he that doeth righteousness is righteous, as he is
righteous.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are the words of God, and therefore
I cannot err in quoting of them, though I may not so fully as I
would make the glory of them shine in speaking to them.</p>
<p>But what righteousness is that, with which a man must stand
righteous in the judgment of the law, before he shall or can be
found to do acts of righteousness, that by the gospel are so
called?</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; I answer, first, It is none of his own which is of
the law, you may be sure: for he hath his righteousness before he
doth any that can be called his own.&nbsp; &ldquo;He that doeth
righteousness is righteous&rdquo; already, precedent to, or
before he doth that righteousness; yea, he &ldquo;is righteous,
even as he is righteous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; It cannot be his own which is of the gospel; that is,
that which floweth from a principle of grace in the soul: for he
is righteous before he doth this righteousness.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
that doeth righteousness is righteous.&rdquo;&nbsp; He doth not
say, he that hath done it, but he that doth it; respecting the
act while it is in doing, he is righteous.&nbsp; He is righteous
even then when he is a-doing of the very first act of
righteousness; but an act, while it is doing, cannot, until it is
done, be called an act of righteousness; yet, saith the text,
&ldquo;he is righteous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But again, if an act, while it is doing, cannot be called an
act of righteousness, to be sure, it cannot have such influences
as to make the actor righteous&mdash;to make him righteous, as
the Son of God is righteous; and yet the righteousness with which
this doer is made righteous, and that before he doth
righteousness, is such; for so saith the text, that makes him
righteous, as he is righteous.</p>
<p>Besides, it cannot be his own, which is gospel-righteousness,
flowing from a principle of grace in the soul; for that in its
greatest perfection in us, while we live in this world, is
accompanied with some imperfections; to wit, our faith, love, and
whole course of holiness is wanting, or hath something lacking in
it.&nbsp; They neither are apart, nor when put all together,
perfect, as to the degree, the uttermost degree of
perfection.</p>
<p>But the righteousness under consideration, with which the man,
in that of John, is made righteous, is a perfect righteousness;
not only with respect to the nature of it, as a penny is as
perfect silver as a shilling; nor yet with respect to a
comparative degree, for so a shilling arriveth more toward the
perfection of the number twenty, than doth a twopenny or a
threepenny piece; but it is a righteousness so perfect, that
nothing can be added to, nor can any thing be taken from it; for
so implieth the words of the text, he is righteous as Christ is
righteous; yea, thus righteous before, and in order to his doing
of righteousness.</p>
<p>And in this he is like unto the Son of God, who was also
righteous before he did acts of righteousness referring to a law
of commandment; wherefore it is said, that as he is, so are we in
this world.&nbsp; As he is or was righteous, before he did acts
of righteousness among men by a law; so are his righteous, before
they act righteousness among men by a law.&nbsp; &ldquo;He that
doeth righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christ was righteous before he did righteousness, with a
twofold righteousness.&nbsp; He had a righteousness as he was
God; his Godhead was perfectly righteous: yea, it was
righteousness itself.&nbsp; His human nature was perfectly
righteous, it was naturally spotless and undefiled.&nbsp; Thus
his person was righteous, and so qualified to do that
righteousness, that because he was born of woman, and made under
the law, he was bound by the law to perform.</p>
<p>Now, as he is, so are we; not by way of natural righteousness,
but by way of resemblance thereunto.&nbsp; Had Christ, in order
to his working of righteousness, a two fold righteousness
inherent in himself?&mdash;the Christian, in order to his working
of righteousness, had belonging to him a twofold
righteousness.&nbsp; Did Christ&rsquo;s twofold righteousness
qualify him for that work of righteousness that was of God
designed for him to do?&mdash;why, the Christian&rsquo;s twofold
righteousness doth qualify him for that work of righteousness
that God hath ordained that he should do and walk in this
world.</p>
<p>But you may ask, What is that righteousness with which a
Christian is made righteous before he doth righteousness?</p>
<p>I answer, It is a twofold righteousness.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; It is a righteousness put upon him.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; It is a righteousness put into him.</p>
<p>For the first, It is a righteousness put upon him, with which
also he is clothed as with a coat or mantle, Rom. iii. 22, and
this is called &ldquo;the robe of righteousness;&rdquo; and this
is called &ldquo;the garment of salvation;&rdquo; Isa. lxi.
10.</p>
<p>This righteousness is none other but the obedience of Christ;
the which he performed in the days of his flesh, and can properly
be called no man&rsquo;s righteousness, but the righteousness of
Christ; because no man had a hand therein, but he completed it
himself.&nbsp; And hence it is said, that &ldquo;by the obedience
of one shall many be made righteous;&rdquo; Rom. v. 19.&nbsp; By
the obedience of one, of one man Jesus Christ (as you have it in
verse 15); for he came down into the world, to this very end;
that is, to make a generation righteous, not by making of them
laws, and prescribing unto them rules (for this was the work of
Moses, who said, &ldquo;And it shall be our righteousness, if we
observe to do all these commandments before the Lord our God, as
he hath commanded us;&rdquo; Deut. vi. 25; xxiv. 13); nor yet by
taking away by his grace the imperfections of their
righteousness, and so making of that perfect by additions of his
own; but he makes them righteous by his obedience, not in them,
but for them, while he personally subjected himself to his
Father&rsquo;s law on our behalf, that he might have a
righteousness to bestow upon us.&nbsp; And hence we are said to
be made righteous, while we work not, and to be justified, while
ungodly (Rom. iv. 5), which can be done by no other righteousness
than that which is the righteousness of Christ by performance,
the righteousness of God by donation, and our righteousness by
imputation.&nbsp; For, I say, the person that wrought this
righteousness for us, is Jesus Christ; the person that giveth it
to us, is the Father; who hath made Christ to be unto us
righteousness, and hath given him to us for this very end, that
we might be made the righteousness of God in him; 1 Cor. i. 4; 2
Cor. v. 21.&nbsp; And hence it is often said, &ldquo;One shall
say, Surely in the Lord have I righteousness and
strength.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again, &ldquo;In the Lord shall all
the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord; and
their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord;&rdquo; Isa. xlv.
24, 25; liv. 17.</p>
<p>This righteousness is that which justifieth, and which
secureth the soul from the curse of the law; by hiding, through
its perfection, all the sins and imperfections of the soul.&nbsp;
Hence it follows, &ldquo;Even as David also describeth the
blessedness of the man unto whom God imputeth righteousness
without works, saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are
forgiven, and whose sins are covered.&nbsp; Blessed is the man to
whom the Lord will not impute sin;&rdquo; Rom. iv.</p>
<p>And this it doth, even while the person, that by grace is made
a partaker, is without good works, and so ungodly.&nbsp; This is
the righteousness of Christ, Christ&rsquo;s personal
performances, which he did when he was in this world; that is
that by which the soul, while naked, is covered, and so hid as to
its nakedness, from the divine sentence of the law: &ldquo;I
spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness,&rdquo;
Ezek. xvi. 4&ndash;9.</p>
<p>Now this obediential righteousness of Christ consisteth of two
parts. 1.&nbsp; In a doing of that which the law commanded us to
do. 2.&nbsp; In a paying that price for the transgression
thereof, which justice hath said shall be required at the hand of
man; and that is the cursed death.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the day that
thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die the death;&rdquo; to
wit, the death that comes by the curse of the law.&nbsp; So then,
Christ having brought in that part of obedience for us, which
consisteth in a doing of such obediential acts of righteousness
which the law commands, he adds thereto the spilling of his
blood, to be the price of our redemption from that cursed death,
that by sin we had brought upon our bodies and souls.&nbsp; And
thus are the Christians perfectly righteous; they have the whole
obedience of Christ made over to them; to wit, that obedience
that standeth in doing the law, and that obedience that standeth
in paying of a price for our transgressions.&nbsp; So, then, doth
the law call for righteousness? here it is.&nbsp; Doth the law
call for satisfaction for our sins?&nbsp; Here it is.&nbsp; And
what can the law say any more to the sinner but that which is
good, when he findeth in the personal obedience of Christ for
him, that which answereth to what it can command, that which it
can demand of us?</p>
<p>Herein, then, standeth a Christian&rsquo;s safety, not in a
bundle of actions of his own, but in a righteousness which cometh
to him by grace and gift; for this righteousness is such as comes
by gift, by the gift of God.&nbsp; Hence it is called the gift of
righteousness, the gift by grace, the gift of righteousness by
grace, which is the righteousness of one, to wit, the obedience
of Jesus Christ, Rom. v. 15&ndash;19.</p>
<p>And this is the righteousness by which he that doth
righteousness is righteous as he is righteous; because it is the
very self-same righteousness that the Son of God hath
accomplished by himself.&nbsp; Nor has he any other or more
excellent righteousness, of which the law taketh notice, or that
it requireth, than this: for as for the righteousness of his
Godhead, the law is not concerned with that; for as he is such,
the law is his creature, and servant, and may not meddle with
him.</p>
<p>The righteousness also of his human nature, the law hath
nothing to do with that; for that is the workmanship of God, and
is as good, as pure, as holy, and undefiled, as is the law
itself.&nbsp; All then that the law hath to do with, is to exact
complete obedience of him that is made under it, and a due
satisfaction for the breach thereof; the which, if it hath, then
Moses is content.</p>
<p>Now, this is the righteousness with which the Christian, as to
justification, is made righteous; to wit, a righteousness that is
neither essential to his Godhead, nor to his manhood; but such as
standeth in that glorious person (who was such) his obedience to
the law.&nbsp; Which righteousness himself had, with reference to
himself, no need of at all, for his Godhead, yea, his manhood,
was perfectly righteous without it.&nbsp; This righteousness
therefore was there, and there only necessary, where Christ was
considered as God&rsquo;s servant (and our surety) to bring to
God Jacob again, and to restore the preserved of Israel.&nbsp;
For though Christ was a Son, yet he became a servant to do, not
for himself, for he had no need, but for us, the whole law, and
so bring in everlasting righteousness for us.</p>
<p>And hence it is said, that Christ did what he did for
us.&nbsp; He became the end of the law for righteousness for us;
he suffered for us, he died for us, he laid down his life for us,
and he gave himself for us.&nbsp; The righteousness then that
Christ did fulfil, when he was in the world, was not for himself
simply considered, nor for himself personally considered, for he
had no need thereof; but it was for the elect, the members of his
body.</p>
<p>Christ then did not fulfil the law for himself, for he had no
need thereof.&nbsp; Christ again did fulfil the law for himself,
for he had need of the righteousness thereof; he had need thereof
for the covering of his body, and the several members thereof;
for they, in a good sense, are himself, members of his body, of
his flesh, and of his bones; and he owns them as parts of himself
in many places of the holy scriptures; Eph. v. 30; Acts ix. 4, 5;
Matt. xxv. 45; x. 40; Mark ix. 37; Luke x. 16; 1 Cor. xii. 12,
27.&nbsp; This righteousness then, even the whole of what Christ
did in answer to the law, it was for us; and God hath put it upon
them, and they were righteous in it, even righteous as he is
righteous.&nbsp; And this they have before they do acts of
righteousness.</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, There is righteousness put into them, before
they act righteous things.&nbsp; A righteousness, I say, put into
them; or I had rather that you should call it a principle of
righteousness; for it is a principle of life to
righteousness.&nbsp; Before man&rsquo;s conversion, there is in
him a principle of death to sin; but when he is converted to
Christ, there is put in him a principle of righteousness, that he
may bring forth fruit unto God; Rom. vii. 4&ndash;6.</p>
<p>Hence they are said to be quickened, to be made alive, to be
risen from death to life, to have the Spirit of God dwelling in
them; not only to make their souls alive, but to quicken their
mortal bodies to that which is good; Rom. viii. 11.</p>
<p>Here, as I hinted before, they that do righteousness are said
to be born of him, that is, antecedent to their doing of
righteousness, 1 John ii. 29; &ldquo;born of him,&rdquo; that is,
made alive with new, spiritual, and heavenly life.&nbsp;
Wherefore the exhortation to them is, &ldquo;Neither yield ye
your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin; but
yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead,
and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God;&rdquo;
Rom. vi. 13.</p>
<p>Now this principle must also be in men, before they can do
that which is spiritual: for whatever seeming good thing any man
doth, before he has bestowed upon him this heavenly principle
from God, it is accounted nothing, it is accounted sin and
abomination in the sight of God; for an evil tree cannot bring
forth good fruit: &ldquo;Men do not gather grapes of thorns;
neither of a bramble gather figs.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is not the
fruit that makes the tree, but the tree that makes the
fruit.&nbsp; A man must be good, before he can do good; and evil
before he can do evil.</p>
<p>This is that which is asserted by the Son of God himself; and
it lieth so level with reason and the nature of things, that it
cannot be contradicted: Matth. vii. 16&ndash;18; Luke vi.
43&ndash;45.&nbsp; &ldquo;A good man, out of the good treasure of
his heart, bringeth forth that which is good: and an evil man,
out of the evil treasure of his heart, bringeth forth that which
is evil.&rdquo;&nbsp; But notwithstanding all that can be said,
it seemeth very strange to the carnal world; for they will not be
otherwise persuaded, but that they be good deeds that make good
men, and evil ones that make evil men.&nbsp; And so, by such
dotish apprehensions, do what in them lieth to fortify their
hearts with the mists of darkness against the clear shining of
the word, and conviction of the truth.</p>
<p>And thus it was from the beginning.&nbsp; Abel&rsquo;s first
services to God were from this principle of righteousness; but
Cain would have been made righteous by his deeds; but his deeds
not flowing from the same root of goodness, as did Abel&rsquo;s,
notwithstanding he did it with the very best he had, is yet
called evil: for he wanted, I say, the principles, to wit, of
grace and faith, without which no action can be counted good in a
gospel-sense.</p>
<p>These two things, then, that man must have that will do
righteousness.&nbsp; He must have put upon him the perfect
righteousness of Christ: and he must have that dwelling in him,
as a fruit of the new birth, a principle of righteousness.&nbsp;
Then indeed he is a tree of righteousness, and God is like to be
glorified in and by him; but this the Pharisee was utterly
ignorant of, and at the remotest distance from.</p>
<p>You may ask me next, But which of these are first bestowed
upon the Christian&mdash;the perfect righteousness of Christ unto
justification, or this gospel-principle of righteousness unto
sanctification?</p>
<p><i>Answ</i>.&nbsp; The perfect righteousness of Christ unto
justification must first be made over to him by an act of
grace.&nbsp; This is evident,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Because he is justified as ungodly; that is, whilst
he is ungodly: but it must not be said of them that have this
principle of grace in them, that they are ungodly; for they are
saints and holy.&nbsp; But this righteousness, by it God
justifieth the ungodly, by imputing it to them, when and while
they, as to a principle of grace, are graceless.</p>
<p>This is further manifested thus: The person must be accepted
before his performance can; &ldquo;And the Lord had respect unto
Abel, and to his offering;&rdquo; Gen. iv.&nbsp; If he had
respect to Abel&rsquo;s person first, yet he must have respect
unto it for the sake of some righteousness; but Abel as yet had
no righteousness; for that he acted, after God had a respect unto
his person.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the Lord had respect unto Abel, and
to his offering: but unto Cain, and to his offering, he had no
respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prophet Ezekiel also shews us this, where, by the
similitude of the wretched infant, and of the manner of
God&rsquo;s receiving it to mercy, he shews how he received the
Jews to favour.&nbsp; First, saith he, &ldquo;I spread my skirt
over thee, and covered thy nakedness.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is
justification; &ldquo;I covered thy nakedness.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
what manner of nakedness was it?&nbsp; Yes, it was then as naked
as naked could be, even as naked as in the day that it was born;
Ezek. xvi. 4&ndash;9.&nbsp; And as thus naked, it was covered,
not with any thing but with the skirt of Christ; that is, with
his robe of righteousness, with his obedience, that he performed
of himself for that very purpose; for by the obedience of one,
many are made righteous.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Righteousness unto justification must be first;
because the first duty that a Christian performeth to God, must
be accepted, not for the sake of the principle from which in the
heart it flows, nor yet for the sake of the person that acts it,
but for the sake of Christ, whose righteousness it is by which
the sinner stands just before God.&nbsp; And hence it is said,
&ldquo;By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice
than Cain,&rdquo; Heb. xi.&nbsp; By faith he did it; but faith in
respect to the righteousness that justifies; for we are justified
by faith; not by faith as it is an acting grace, but the
righteousness of faith, that is, by that righteousness that faith
embraceth, layeth hold of, and helpeth the soul to rest and trust
to, for justification of life, which is the obedience of
Christ.&nbsp; Besides, it is said, by faith he offered; faith
then in Christ was precedent to his offering.</p>
<p>Now, since faith was in act before his offer, and since before
his offer he had no personal goodness of his own, faith must look
out from home; I say to another for righteousness; and finding
the righteousness of Christ to be the righteousness which by God
was designed to be performed for the justification of a sinner,
it embraces it, and through it offereth to God a more excellent
sacrifice than Cain.</p>
<p>Hence it follows, &ldquo;By which he obtained witness that he
was righteous;&rdquo; by which, not by his offering, but by his
faith; for his offering, simply as an offering, could not have
made him righteous if he had not been righteous before; for
&ldquo;an evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Besides, if this be granted, why had not God respect to
Cain&rsquo;s offering as well as to Abel&rsquo;s?&nbsp; For did
Abel offer?&nbsp; So did Cain.&nbsp; Did Abel offer his
best?&nbsp; So did Cain his.&nbsp; And if with this we shall take
notice of the order of their offspring, Cain seemed to offer
first, and so with the frankest will and forwardest mind; but
yet, saith the text, &ldquo;The Lord had respect to Abel and to
his offering.&rdquo;&nbsp; But why to Abel?&nbsp; Why, because
his, person was made righteous before he offered his gift:
&ldquo;By which he obtained witness that he was righteous;&rdquo;
God testifying of his gifts, that they were good and acceptable
because they declared Abel&rsquo;s acceptation of the
righteousness of Christ, through the riches of the grace of
God.</p>
<p>By faith, then, Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice
than Cain.&nbsp; He shrouded himself under the righteousness of
Christ, and so, of that righteousness, he offered to God.&nbsp;
God also looking and finding him there (where he could not have
been, as to his own apprehension, no otherwise than by faith),
accepted of his gift; by which acceptation (for so you may
understand it also) God testifieth that he was righteous, for God
receiveth not the gifts and offerings of those that are not
righteous, for their sacrifices are an abomination unto him,
Prov. xxi. 27.</p>
<p>Abel then was, I say, made righteous, first, as he stood
ungodly in himself; God justifieth the ungodly, Rom. iv.&nbsp;
Now, being justified, he was righteous; and being righteous, he
offered his sacrifice of praise to God, or other offerings which
God accepted, because he believed in his Son.&nbsp; But this our
Pharisee understandeth not.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Righteousness by imputation must be first, because we
are made so, to wit, by another&mdash;&ldquo;By the obedience of
one shall many be made righteous.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now to be made
righteous, implies a passiveness in him that is so made, and the
activity of the work to lie in some body else; except he had
said, they had made themselves righteous; but that it doth not,
nor doth the text leave to any the least countenance so to
insinuate; nay, it plainly affirms the contrary, for it saith, by
the obedience of one, of one man, Jesus Christ, many are made
righteous; by the righteousness of one, Rom. v.&nbsp; So then, if
they be made righteous by the righteousness of one; I say if many
be made righteous by the righteousness of one, then are they that
are so, as to themselves, passive and not active, with reference
to the working out of this righteousness.&nbsp; They have no hand
in that; for that is the act of one, the righteousness of one,
the obedience of one, the workmanship of one, even of Christ
Jesus.</p>
<p>Again, If they are made righteous by this righteousness, then
also they are passive as to their first privilege by it; for they
are made righteous by it; they do not make themselves righteous
by it.</p>
<p>Imputation is also the act of God.&nbsp; &ldquo;Even as David
also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God
imputeth righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; The righteousness then is a
work of Christ, his own obedience to his Father&rsquo;s law; the
making of it ours is the act of the Father, and of his infinite
grace: &ldquo;For of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is
made unto us wisdom and righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;For
God hath made Jim to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we
might be made the righteousness of God in him.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
both these things God shewed to our first parents, when he acted
in grace towards them after the fall.</p>
<p>There it is said, the Lord God made unto Adam, and unto his
wife, coats of skins, and clothed them; Gen. iii. 21.</p>
<p>Whence note,</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; That Adam and his wife were naked, both in
God&rsquo;s eye and in their own, verses 10, 11.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; That the Lord God made coats of skins.</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; That in his making of them, he had respect to Adam
and to his wife, that is, he made them.</p>
<p>(4.)&nbsp; That when he had made them, he also clothed them
therewith.</p>
<p>They made not the coats, nor did God bid them make them; but
God did make them himself to cover their nakedness with.&nbsp;
Yea, when he had made them, he did not bid them put them on, but
he himself did clothe them with them: for thus runs the text;
&ldquo;Unto Adam also, and to his wife, did the Lord God make
coats of skins, and clothed them.&rdquo;&nbsp; O it was the Lord
God that made this coat with which a poor sinner is made
righteous!&nbsp; And it is also the Lord God that putteth it upon
us.&nbsp; But this our Pharisee understandeth not.</p>
<p>But now, if a man is not righteous before he is made so,
before the Lord God has by the righteousness of another made him
so; then whether this righteousness comes first or last, the man
is not righteous until it cometh; and if he be not righteous
until it cometh, then what works soever are done before it comes,
they are not the works of a righteous man, nor the fruits of a
good tree, but of a bad.&nbsp; And so again, this righteousness
must first come before a man be righteous, and before a man does
righteousness.&nbsp; Make the tree good, and its fruit will be
good.</p>
<p>Now, since a man must be made righteous before he can do
righteousness, it is manifest his works of righteousness do not
make him righteous, no more than the fig makes its own tree a
fig-tree, or than the grape doth make its own vine a vine.&nbsp;
Hence those acts of righteousness that Christian men do perform,
are called the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ
to the glory and praise of God; Phil. i. 11.</p>
<p>The fruits of righteousness they are by Jesus Christ, as the
fruits of the tree are by the tree itself; for the truth is, that
principle of righteousness, of which mention has been made
before, and concerning which I have said it comes in in the
second place; it is also originally to be found for us nowhere
but in Christ.</p>
<p>Hence it is said to be by Jesus Christ; and again, &ldquo;Of
his fulness have we all received, and grace for grace;&rdquo;
John i. 16.&nbsp; A man must then be united to Christ first, and
so being united, he partaketh of this benefit, to wit, a
principle that is supernatural, spiritual, and heavenly.&nbsp;
Now, his being united to Christ, is not of or from himself, but
of and from the Father, who, as to this work, is the husbandman;
even as the twig that is grafted into the tree officiateth not,
that is, grafteth not itself thereunto, but is grafted in by some
other, itself being utterly passive as to that.&nbsp; Now, being
united unto Christ, the soul is first made partaker of
justification, or of justifying righteousness, and now no longer
beareth the name of an ungodly man; for he is made righteous by
the obedience of Christ; he being also united to Christ,
partaketh of the root and fatness of Christ; the root, that is,
his divine nature; the fatness, that is, the fulness of grace
that is laid up in him to be communicated unto us, even as the
branch that is grafted into the olive-tree partaketh of the root
and fatness of the olive-tree.&nbsp; Now partaking thereof, it
quickeneth, it groweth, it buddeth, and yieldeth fruit to the
praise and glory of God; Rom. xi. 17.</p>
<p>But these things, as I have often said, the poor Pharisee was
ignorant of, when so swaggeringly he, with his &ldquo;God, I
thank thee,&rdquo; came into the temple to pray.&nbsp; And,
indeed, in that which hath been said is something of the mystery
of God&rsquo;s will in his way with his elect; and such a mystery
it is, that it lieth hid for ever to nature and natural men; for
they think of nothing less than of this, nor of nothing more,
when they think of their souls and of salvation, than that
something must be done by themselves to reconcile them to
God.&nbsp; Yea, if through some common convictions their
understandings should be swayed to a consenting to that, that
justification is of grace by Christ, and not of works by men; yet
conscience, reason, and the law of nature, not being as yet
subdued by the power and glory of grace unto the obedience of
Christ, will rise up in rebellion against this doctrine, and will
over-rule and bow down the soul again to the law and works
thereof for life.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Righteousness by imputation must be first, because,
else faith, which is a part, yea, a greater part of that which is
called a principle of grace in the soul, will have nothing to fix
itself upon, nor a motive to work by.&nbsp; Let this therefore be
considered by those that are on the contrary side.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Faith, so soon as it has a being in the soul, is like
the child that has a being in the mother&rsquo;s lap; it must
have something to feed upon; not something at a distance, afar
off, to be purchased (I speak now as to justification from the
curse), but something by promise made over of grace to the soul;
something to feed upon to support from the fears of perishing by
the curse for sin.&nbsp; Nor can it rest content with all duties
and performances that other graces shall put the soul upon; nor
with any of its own works, until it reaches and takes hold of the
righteousness of Christ.&nbsp; Faith is like the dove, which
found no rest any where until it returned to Noah into the
ark.&nbsp; But this our Pharisee understandeth not.</p>
<p>Perhaps some may object, that from this way of reasoning it is
apparent, that sanctification is first; since the soul may have
faith, and so a principle of grace in it, and yet, as yet it
cannot find Christ to feed and refresh the soul withal.</p>
<p><i>Answ</i>.&nbsp; From this way of reasoning it is not at all
apparent that sanctification, or a principle of grace, is in the
soul before righteousness is imputed and the soul made perfectly
righteous thereby.&nbsp; And for the clearing up of this, let me
propose a few things.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Justifying righteousness, to wit, the obedience of
that one man, Christ, is imputed to the sinner, to justify him in
God&rsquo;s sight; for his law calls for perfect righteousness,
and before that be come to, and put upon the poor sinner, God
cannot bestow other spiritual blessings upon him; because by the
law he has pronounced him accursed; by the which curse he is also
so holden, until a righteousness shall be found upon the sinner,
that the law and divine justice can approve of, and be contented
within.&nbsp; So then, as to the justification of the sinner,
there must be a righteousness for God; I say, for the sinner, and
for God: for the sinner to be clothed within, and for God to look
upon, that he may, for the sake thereof in a way of justice,
bless the sinner with forgiveness of sins: for forgiveness of
sins is the next thing that followeth upon the appearance of the
sinner before God in the righteousness of Christ; Rom. iv. 6,
7.</p>
<p>Now, upon this forgiveness follows the second blessing.&nbsp;
Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a
curse for us; and so, consequently, hath obtained for us the
forgiveness of sins: for he that is delivered from the curse hath
received forgiveness of sins, or rather is made partaker
thereof.&nbsp; Now, being made a partaker thereof, the second
blessing immediately follows, to wit, the blessing of Abraham,
that is, the promise of the Spirit through faith; Gal. iii. 13.
14.&nbsp; But this our Pharisee understandeth not.</p>
<p>But now, although it be of absolute necessity that imputed
righteousness be first, to the soul; that is, that perfect
righteousness be found upon the sinner first by God, that he may
bestow other blessings in a way of justice:</p>
<p>Let God then put the righteousness of his Son upon me; and by
virtue of that, let the second blessing of God come into me; and
by virtue of that, let me be made to see myself a sinner, and
Christ&rsquo;s righteousness, and my need of it, in the doctrine
of it, as it is revealed in the scriptures of truth.&nbsp; Let me
then believe this doctrine to be true, and be brought by my
belief to repentance for my sins, to hungering and thirsting
vehemently after this righteousness: for this is the kingdom of
God, and his righteousness.&nbsp; Yea, let me pray, and cry, and
sigh, and groan, day and night, to the God of this righteousness,
that he will of grace make me a partaker.&nbsp; And let me thus
be prostrate before my God, all the time that in wisdom he shall
think fit; and in his own time he shall shew me that I am a
justified person, a pardoned person, a person in whom the Spirit
of God hath dwelt for some time, though I knew it not.</p>
<p>So then, justification before God is one thing, and
justification in mine own eyes is another; not that these are two
justifications, but the same righteousness by which I stand
justified before God, may be seen of God, when I am ignorant of
it: yea, for the sake of it I may be received, pardoned, and
accounted righteous of him, and yet I may not understand
it.&nbsp; Yea, further, he may proceed in the way of blessing to
bless me with additional blessings, and yet I be ignorant of
it.</p>
<p>So that the question is not, Do I find that I am righteous?
but, Am I so?&nbsp; Doth God find me so, when he seeth that the
righteousness of his Son is upon me, being made over to me by an
act of his grace?&nbsp; For I am justified freely by his grace,
through the redemption which is in Jesus Christ, whom God hath
set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to
declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are
past, through the forbearance of God; Rom. iii. 24.&nbsp; But
this our Pharisee understandeth not.</p>
<p>I am then made righteous first by the righteousness of
another; and because I am thus righteous, God accepteth of my
person as such, and bestoweth upon me his grace; the which, at
first, for want of skill and experience in the word of
righteousness, I make use of but poorly, and have need to be
certified that I am made righteous, and that I have eternal life;
not by faith first and immediately, but by the written word which
is called &ldquo;the word of faith;&rdquo; which word declareth
unto me (to whom grace, and so faith in the seed of it, is
given), that I have eternal life, and that I should with
boldness, in peace and joy, believe on the Son of God; Heb. v.
13; Rom. xv. 13; 1 John v. 13.&nbsp; But,</p>
<p>Again, I, in the first acts of my faith, when I come at
Christ, do not accept of him, because I know I am righteous,
either with imputed righteousness, or with that which is
inherent.&nbsp; Both these, as to my present privilege in them,
may be hidden from mine eyes, and I only put upon taking of
encouragement to close with Christ for life and righteousness, as
he is set forth to be a propitiation before mine eyes, in the
word of the truth of the gospel; to which word I adhere as, or
because I find, I want peace with God in my soul, and because I
am convinced that the means of peace is not to be found any where
but in Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Now, by my thus adhering to him, I
find stay for my soul, and peace to my conscience, because the
word doth ascertain to me, that he that believeth on him hath
remission of sins, hath eternal life, and shall be saved from the
wrath to come.</p>
<p>But, alas! who knows (the many straits, and as I may say, the
stress of weather, I mean) the cold blasts of hell, with which
the poor soul is assaulted, betwixt its receiving of grace, and
its sensible closing with Jesus Christ?&nbsp; None, I dare say,
but it and its fellows.&nbsp; &ldquo;The heart knows its own
bitterness; and a stranger intermeddleth not with his joy;&rdquo;
Prov. xiv. 10.&nbsp; No sooner doth Satan perceive what God is
doing with the soul, in a way of grace and mercy, but he
endeavoureth what he may to make the renewing thereof bitter and
wearisome work to the sinner.&nbsp; O what mists, what mountains,
what clouds, what darkness, what objections, what false
apprehensions of God, of Christ, of grace, of the word, and of
the soul&rsquo;s condition, doth he now lay before it, and haunt
it with; whereby he dejecteth, casteth down, daunteth,
distresseth, and almost driveth it quite into despair!&nbsp; Now,
by the reason of these things, faith (and all the grace that is
in the soul) is hard put to it to come at the promise, and by the
promise of Christ; as it is said, when the tempest and great
danger of shipwreck lay upon the vessel in which Paul was, they
had &ldquo;much work to come by the boat;&rdquo; Acts xxvii.
16.&nbsp; For Satan&rsquo;s design is, if he cannot keep the soul
from Christ, to make his coming to him, and closing with him, as
hard, as difficult and troublesome, as he by his devices
can.&nbsp; But faith, true justifying faith, is a grace, is not
weary by all that Satan can do; but meditateth upon the word, and
taketh stomach, and courage, fighteth and crieth, and by crying
and fighting, by help from heaven, its way is made through all
the oppositions that appear so mighty, and draweth up at last to
Jesus Christ, into whose bosom it putteth the soul, where, for
the time, it sweetly resteth, after its marvellous tossings to
and fro.</p>
<p>And besides what hath been said, let me yet illustrate this
truth unto you by this familiar similitude.</p>
<p>Suppose a man, a traitor, that by the law should die for his
sin, is yet such an one that the king has exceeding kindness for;
may not the king pardon this man of his clemency; yea, order that
his pardon should be drawn up and sealed, and so in every sense
be made sure; and yet, for the present, keep all this close
enough from the ears or the knowledge of the person therein
concerned?&nbsp; Yea, may not the king after all leave this
person, with others under the same transgression, to sue for and
obtain this pardon with great expense and difficulty, with many
tears and heart-achings, with many fears and dubious
cogitations?</p>
<p>Why, this is the case between God and the soul that he saveth;
he saveth him, pardoneth him, and secureth him from the curse and
death that is due unto sin, but yet doth not tell him so; but he
ascends in his great suit unto God for it.&nbsp; Only this
difference we must make between God and the potentates of this
world; God cannot pardon before the sinner stands before him
righteous by the righteousness of Christ; because he has in
judgment, and justice, and righteousness, threatened and
concluded, that he that wants righteousness shall die.</p>
<p>And I say again, because this righteousness is God&rsquo;s and
at God&rsquo;s disposal only, it is God that must make a man
righteous before he can forgive him his sins, or bestow upon him
of his secondary blessings; to wit, his Spirit, and the graces
thereof.&nbsp; And I say again, it must be this righteousness;
for it can be no other that justifies a sinner from sin in the
sight of God, and from the sentence of the law.</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, This is, and must be the way of God with the
sinner, that faith may not only have an object to work upon, but
a motive to work by.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; Here, as I said, faith hath an object to work upon,
and that in the person of Christ, and that personal righteousness
of his, which he in the days of his flesh did finish to justify
sinners withal.&nbsp; This is, I say, the object of faith for
justification, whereunto the soul by it doth continually
resort.&nbsp; Hence David saith to Christ, &ldquo;Be thou my
strong habitation (or as you have it in the margin, Be thou to me
a rock of habitation) whereunto I may continually resort;&rdquo;
Psalm lxxi. 3.&nbsp; And two things he infers by so saying.</p>
<p>The first is, That the Christian is a man under continual
exercises, sometimes one way, and sometimes another; but all his
exercises have a tendency in them more or less to spoil him;
therefore he is rather for flying to Christ than for grappling
with them in and by his own power.</p>
<p>The second is, that Christ is of God our shelter as to this
very thing.&nbsp; Hence his name is said to be &ldquo;a strong
tower,&rdquo; and that the righteous run into it, and are safe,
Prov. xviii. 10.&nbsp; That also of David in the fifty-sixth
Psalm is very pregnant to this purpose; &ldquo;Mine
enemies,&rdquo; saith he, &ldquo;would daily swallow me up; for
they be many that fight against me, O thou Most
High.&rdquo;&nbsp; And what then?&nbsp; Why, saith he, &ldquo;I
will trust in thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus you see, faith hath an
object to work upon to carry the soul unto, and to secure the
soul in times of difficulty, and that object is Jesus Christ and
his righteousness.&nbsp; But,</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; Again, as faith hath an object to work upon, so it
hath a motive to work by; and that is the love of God in giving
of Christ to the soul for righteousness.&nbsp; Nor is there any
profession, religion, or duty and performance, that is at all
regarded, where this faith, which by such means can work, is
wanting.&nbsp; &ldquo;For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision
availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but faith which worketh
by love&rdquo; (so Gal. v. 6) acteth lovely; or, by faith whose
fruit is love (though true faith hath love for its offspring) but
faith which worketh by love, that is true, saving, justifying
faith, as it beholdeth the righteousness of Christ as made over
to the soul for justification; so it beholdeth love, love to be
the cause of its so being made over.</p>
<p>It beholdeth love in the Father, in giving of his Son, and
love in the Son, in giving of himself to be made soul-saving
righteousness for me.&nbsp; And seeing it worketh by it, that is,
it is stirred up to an holy boldness of venturing all eternal
concerns upon Christ, and also to an holy, endeared, affecting
love of him, for his sweet and blessed redeeming love.&nbsp;
Hence the apostle saith, &ldquo;The love of Christ constraineth
us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were
all dead: and that he died for all, that they which live, should
not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for
them and rose again,&rdquo; 2 Cor. v. 14, 15.</p>
<p>Thus then is the heart united in affection and love to the
Father and the Son, for the love that they have shewed to the
poor sinner in their thus delivering him from the wrath to
come.&nbsp; For by this love faith worketh, in sweet passions and
pangs of love, to all that are thus reconciled, as this sinner
seeth he is.&nbsp; The motive then, whereby faith worketh, both
as to justification and sanctification, the great motive to them,
I say, is love, the love of God, and the love of Christ:
&ldquo;We love him, because he first loved us.&rdquo;&nbsp; That
is, when our faith hath told us so; for so are the words above,
&ldquo;We have known and believed the love that God hath to
us.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then, &ldquo;We love him, because he first
loved us.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then, &ldquo;This commandment have we
from him, that he that loveth God, loveth his brother
also,&rdquo; 1 John iv. 16&ndash;21.&nbsp; But this our poor
Pharisee understandeth not.&nbsp; But,</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Righteousness by imputation must be first, to cut off
boasting from the heart, conceit, and lips of men.&nbsp;
Wherefore he saith, as before, that we are justified freely by
the grace of God, not through, or for the sake of an holy
gospel-principle in us; but &ldquo;through the redemption that is
in Jesus Christ,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where is boasting
then?&nbsp; It is excluded.&nbsp; By what law?&nbsp; Of
works?&nbsp; Nay, but by the law of faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this
is the law of faith, by which we are justified as before; Rom.
iii. 27, 28.</p>
<p>Nor can any man propound such an essential way to cut off
boasting as this, which is of God&rsquo;s providing: For what is
man here to boast of?&nbsp; No righteousness, nor yet of the
application of it to his soul.&nbsp; The righteousness is
Christ&rsquo;s, not the sinner&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The imputation is
God&rsquo;s, not the sinner&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The cause of
imputation is God&rsquo;s grace and love, not the sinner&rsquo;s
works of righteousness.&nbsp; The time of God&rsquo;s imputing
righteousness is when the sinner was a sinner, wrapped up in
ignorance, and wallowing in his vanity; not when he was good, or
when he was seeking of it; for his inward gospel-goodness is a
fruit of the imputation of justifying righteousness.&nbsp; Where
is boasting then?&nbsp; Where is our Pharisee then, with his
brags of not being as other men are?&nbsp; It is excluded, and he
with it, and the poor Publican taken into favour, that boasting
might be cut off.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not of works, lest any man should
boast.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is no trust to be put in men; those
that seem most humble, and that to appearance, and farthest off
from pride, it is natural to them to boast; yea, now they have no
cause to boast; for by grace are we saved through faith, and that
not of ourselves, it is the gift of God.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not of
works, lest any man should boast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if man is so prone to boast, when yet there is no pound of
boasting in him, nor yet in what he doth; how would he have
boasted had he been permitted by the God of heaven to have done
something, though that something had been but a very little
something, towards his justification?&nbsp; But God has prevented
boasting by doing as he has done; Eph. ii. 8, 9.&nbsp; Nay, the
apostle addeth further (lest any man should boast), that as to
good works, &ldquo;We are God&rsquo;s workmanship, created in
Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that
we should walk in them;&rdquo; ver. 10.&nbsp; Can the tree boast,
since it was God that made it such?&nbsp; Where is boasting
then?&nbsp; &ldquo;But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God
is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification,
and redemption: that, according as it is written, he that
glorieth, let him glory in the Lord;&rdquo; 1 Cor. i. 30,
31.&nbsp; Where is boasting then?&nbsp; Where is our Pharisee
then, with all his works of righteousness, and with his boasts of
being better than his neighbours?</p>
<p>It may be said, If we should be justified for the sake of our
inherent righteousness, since that righteousness is the gift of
God, will it not follow that boasting is, in the occasion
thereof, cut off?</p>
<p><i>Answ</i>.&nbsp; No; for although the principle of inherent
righteousness be the gift of God, yet it bringeth forth fruits by
man, and through man; and so man having a hand therein, though he
should have ever so little, he has an occasion offered him to
boast.&nbsp; Yea, if a man should be justified before God by the
grace, or the working of the grace of faith in him, he would have
ground of occasion to boast; because faith, though it be the gift
of God, yet as it acteth in man, takes man along with it in its
so acting; yea, the acting of faith is as often attributed to the
man by whom it is acted, and oftener, than to the grace
itself.&nbsp; How then can it be, but that man must have a hand
therein, and so a ground therein, or thereof to boast?</p>
<p>But now, since justification from the curse of the law before
God lieth only and wholly in God&rsquo;s imputing of
Christ&rsquo;s righteousness to a man, and that too, while the
man to whom it is imputed is in himself wicked and ungodly, there
is no room left for boasting before God, for that is the boasting
intended; but rather an occasion given to shame and confusion of
face, and to stop the mouth for ever, since justification comes
in a way so far above him, so vastly without him, his skill,
help, or what else soever; Ezek. xvi. 61&ndash;63.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Righteousness by imputation must be first, that
justification may not be of debt, but of mercy and grace.&nbsp;
This is evident from reason.&nbsp; It is meet that God should
therefore justify us by a righteousness of his own, not of his
own prescribing; for that he may do, and yet the righteousness be
ours; but of his own providing, that the righteousness may be
his.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now to him that worketh is the reward not
reckoned of grace, but of debt;&rdquo; Rom. iv. 2&ndash;4.&nbsp;
If I work for justifying righteousness, and that way get
righteousness, my justification is not of grace, but of
debt.&nbsp; God giveth it not unto me, but he oweth it unto me;
so then it is no longer his, but mine: mine, not of grace, but of
debt.&nbsp; And if so, then I thank him not for his remission of
sins, nor for the kingdom of heaven, nor for eternal life; for if
justifying righteousness is of debt, then when I have it, and
what dependeth thereon, I have but mine own; that which God oweth
to me.</p>
<p>Nor will it help at all to say, But I obtain it by God&rsquo;s
grace in me; because that doth not cut off my works, nor prevent
my having of a hand in my justifying righteousness.</p>
<p>Suppose I give a man materials, even all materials that are
necessary to the completing of such or such a thing; yet if he
worketh, though the materials be mine, I am to him a debtor, and
he deserveth a reward.&nbsp; Thou sayst, God has given thee his
Spirit, his grace, and all other things that are necessary for
the working up of a complete righteousness.&nbsp; Well, but is
thy work required to the finishing of this righteousness?&nbsp;
If so, this is not the righteousness that justifieth; because it
is such as has thy hand, thy workmanship therein, and so obtains
a reward.&nbsp; And observe it, righteousness, justifying
righteousness, consisteth not in a principle of righteousness,
but in works of righteousness; that is, in good duties, in
obedience, in a walking in the law to the pleasing of the law,
and the content of the justice of God.</p>
<p>I suppose again, that thou shalt conclude with me, that
justifying righteousness, I mean that which justifies from the
curse of the law, resideth only in the obedience of the Son of
God; and that the principle of grace that is in thee is none of
that righteousness, no, not then when thou hast to the utmost
walked with God according to thy gift and grace; yet if thou
concludest that this principle must be in thee, and these works
done by thee, before this justifying righteousness is imputed to
thee for justification, thou layest in a caveat against
justification by grace; and also concludest, that though thou art
not justified by thy righteousness, but by Christ, yet thou art
justified by Christ&rsquo;s righteousness for the sake of thine
own, and so makest justification to be still a debt.&nbsp; But
here the scripture doth also cut thee off: &ldquo;Not for thy
righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou
go to possess the land&rdquo; (which was but a type of heaven);
and if our righteousness cannot give us, by its excellency, a
share in the type, be sure that for it we shall never be sharers
in the anti-type itself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Understand, therefore, that
the Lord thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for
thy righteousness; for thou art a stiff-necked people;&rdquo;
Deut. ix. 5, 6.</p>
<p>Gospel-performances, therefore, are not first; that was first,
for the sake of which God did receive these people into favour
with himself, and that was a covenant-righteousness; and where
could that covenant-righteousness be found, but in the Prince,
Mediator, and High Priest of the covenant?&nbsp; For it was he,
and he only, that was appointed of God, nor could any but himself
bring in everlasting righteousness; Dan. ix. 24, 25.&nbsp; This
is evident from these texts last mentioned; it was not for their
righteousness that they possessed the land.</p>
<p>Again, As it was not for their righteousness that they were
made possessors of the land, so it was not for the sake of their
righteousness that they were made partakers of such a
righteousness that did make them possess the land.&nbsp; This is
plain to reason; for personal righteousness, when by us
performed, is of no worth to obtain of God a justifying
righteousness.&nbsp; But if it be of no worth to obtain a
justifying righteousness, then, it seems, it is more commodious
to both parties than justifying righteousness.&nbsp; First, it is
more commodious to him that worketh it; and, secondly, it is more
commodious unto him that receiveth it, else why doth he for it
give us a due debt, and so put upon us the everlasting justifying
righteousness?</p>
<p>Perhaps it will be objected, That God doth all this of grace;
but I answer, That these are but fallacious words, spoken by the
tongue of the crafty.&nbsp; For we are not now discoursing of
what rewards God can give to the operations of his own grace in
us, but whether he can in a way of justice (or how he will)
bestow any spiritual blessing upon sinful creatures, against
whom, for sin, he has pronounced the curse of the law, before he
hath found them in a righteousness, that is proved to be as good
justice and righteousness, as is the justice and righteousness of
the law, with which we have to do.</p>
<p>I assert he cannot, because he cannot lie, because he cannot
deny himself: for if he should first threaten the transgression
of the law with death, and yet afterwards receive the
transgressor to grace, without a plenary satisfaction, what is
this but to lie, and to diminish his truth, righteousness, and
faithfulness; yea, and also to overthrow the sanction and perfect
holiness of his law?&nbsp; His mercy, therefore, must act so
towards the sinner that justice may be satisfied, and that can
never be without a justifying righteousness.</p>
<p>Now what this justifying righteousness should be, and when
imputed, that is the question.&nbsp; I say, it is the
righteousness, or obedience of the Son of God in the flesh, which
he assumed, and so his own, and the righteousness of no body else
otherwise than by imputation.</p>
<p>I say again, that this righteousness must be imputed first,
that the sinner may stand just in God&rsquo;s sight from the
curse, that God might deal with him both in a way of justice as
well as mercy, and yet do the sinner no harm.</p>
<p>But you may ask, how did God deal with sinners before his
righteousness was actually in being?</p>
<p>I answer, He did then deal with sinners even as he dealeth
with them now; he justified them by it, by virtue of the
suretyship of him that was to bring it in.&nbsp; Christ became
surety for us, and by his suretyship laid himself under an
obligation for those for whom he became a surety to bring in this
everlasting and justifying righteousness, and by virtue of this,
those of his elect that came into and went out of the world
before he came to perform his work were saved though the
forbearance of God.&nbsp; Wherefore, before the Lord came, they
were saved for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, and for the sake of his
name.&nbsp; And they that were spiritually wise understood it,
and pleaded it as their necessities required, and the Lord
accepted them; Heb. vii. 22; Rom. iv. 24; Dan. ix. 17; Psalm xxv.
11.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Righteousness by imputation must be first, that
justification may be certain; &ldquo;Therefore it is of faith (of
the righteousness that faith layeth hold on), that it might be by
grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the
seed;&rdquo; Rom. iv. 16.&nbsp; &ldquo;That the
promise,&rdquo;&mdash;What promise?&nbsp; The promise of
remission of sins, &amp;c., might be sure.</p>
<p>Now a promise of remission of sins supposeth a righteousness
going before; for there is no forgiveness of sins, nor promise of
forgiveness, for the sake of righteousness that shall be by us,
but that already found in Christ as head, and so imputed to the
elect for their remission.&nbsp; &ldquo;God for Christ&rsquo;s
sake hath forgiven you,&rdquo; Eph. iv. 32; For Christ&rsquo;s
sake; that this, for the sake of the righteousness of
Christ.&nbsp; Imputed righteousness must be first; yea, it must
be before forgiveness, and forgiveness is extended by God then
when we lie in our blood, though to us it is manifested
afterwards.&nbsp; Therefore it is <i>of</i> faith; he saith not
<i>by</i> it, respecting the act of faith, but of, respecting the
doctrine or word which presenteth me with this blessed imputed
righteousness: they that are of faith are the children of
faithful Abraham.&nbsp; They that are of the doctrine of faith,
for all the elect are the sons of that doctrine in which is this
righteousness of Christ contained; yea, they are begotten by it
of God to this inheritance, to their comfortable enjoyment of the
comfort of it by faith.</p>
<p>That the promise might be sure to all the seed, to all them
wrapped up in the promise, and so begotten and born.&nbsp; That
it might be sure, implying that there is no certain way of
salvation for the elect but this; because God can never by other
means reconcile us to himself, for his heavenly eyes perceive,
yea, they spy faults in the best of our gospel performances; yea,
our faith is faulty, and also imperfect: how then should
remission be extended to us for the sake of that?&nbsp; But now
the righteousness of Christ is perfect, perpetual and stable as
the great mountains; wherefore he is called the rock of our
salvation, because a man may as soon tumble the mountains before
him, as sin can make invalid the righteousness of Christ, when,
and unto whom, God shall impute it for justice; Psalm
xxxvi.&nbsp; In the margin it is said to be like the mountain of
God; to wit, called Mount Zion, or that Moriah on which the
temple was built, and upon which it stood; all other bottoms are
fickle, all other righteousnesses are so feeble, short, narrow,
yea, so full of imperfections; for what the law could not do in
that it was weak through the flesh, Christ did for us in the
similitude of sinful-flesh.&nbsp; But what could not the law
do?&nbsp; Why, it could not give us righteousness, nor strengthen
us to perform it.&nbsp; It could not give us any certain, solid,
well-grounded hope of remission of sin and salvation.</p>
<p>Wherefore this righteousness being imputed, justice findeth no
fault therewith, but consenteth to the extending to the sinner
those blessings that tend to perfect his happiness in the
heavens.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Righteousness by imputation must be first, that in
all things Christ may have the pre-eminence.&nbsp; Christ is head
of the church, and therefore let him have the highest honour in
the soul; but how can he have that, if any precede as to
justification before his perfect righteousness be imputed?&nbsp;
If it be said, grace may be in the soul, though the soul doth not
act it until the moment that justifying righteousness shall be
imputed:</p>
<p>I ask, What should it do there before, or to what purpose is
it there, if it be not acted?&nbsp; And again, how came it
thither, how got the soul possession of it while it was
unjustified? or, How could God in justice give it to a person,
that by the law stood condemned, before they were acquitted from
that condemnation?&nbsp; And I say, nothing can set the soul free
from that curse but the perfect obedience of Christ; nor that
either, if it be not imputed for that end to the sinner by the
grace of God.</p>
<p>Imputed, that is, reckoned or accounted to him.&nbsp; And why
should it not be accounted to him for righteousness?&nbsp; What
did Christ bring it into the world for? for the righteous or for
sinners?&nbsp; No doubt for sinners.&nbsp; And how must it be
reckoned to them?&nbsp; Not in circumcision, but in
uncircumcision; not as righteous, but as sinners.&nbsp; And how
are they to consider of themselves, even then when they first are
apprehensive of their need of this righteousness?&nbsp; Are they
to think that they are righteous, or sinners?</p>
<p>And again, How are they to believe concerning themselves, then
when they put forth the first act of faith towards this
righteousness for justification?&nbsp; Are they to think that
they are righteous, or sinners?&nbsp; Sinners, doubtless, they
are to reckon themselves, and as such to reckon themselves
justified by this righteousness.&nbsp; And this is according to
the sentence of God, as appeareth by such sayings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For when we were yet without strength, in due time
Christ died for the ungodly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while
we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to
God by the death of his Son,&rdquo; &amp;c., Rom. v.</p>
<p>Out of these words I gather these three things.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; That Christ by God&rsquo;s appointment died for
us.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; That by his death he reconciled us to God.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; That even then, when the very act of reconciliation
was in performing, and also when performed, we were ungodly,
sinners, enemies.</p>
<p>Now, the act by which we are said to be reconciled to God,
while ungodly, while sinners, and while enemies, was
Christ&rsquo;s offering himself a sacrifice for us, which is, in
the words above mentioned, called his death.&nbsp; Christ died
for the ungodly; Christ died for us while sinners; Christ
reconciled us to God by his death.&nbsp; And as Christ is said to
die for us, so the Father is said to impute righteousness to us;
to wit, as we are without works, as we are ungodly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that
justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for
righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; He worketh not, but is ungodly, when
this gracious act of God, in imputing the righteousness of Christ
to him, is extended; when he shall believe, his faith is counted
to him for righteousness.&nbsp; And why should we not have the
benefit of the righteousness, since it was completed for us while
we were yet ungodly?&nbsp; Yea, we have the benefit of it:
&ldquo;For when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the
death of his Son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I say the benefit, I mean that benefit that we are
capable of, and that is justification before God; for that a man
may be capable of while he is in himself ungodly, because this
comes to him by the righteousness of another.&nbsp; True, were it
to be his own righteousness by which he was to be justified, he
could not: but the righteousness is Christ&rsquo;s, and that
imputed by God, not as a reward for work, or of debt, but freely
by his grace; and therefore may be, and is so, while the person
concerned is without works, ungodly, and a sinner.</p>
<p>And he that denieth that we are capable of this benefit while
we are sinners and ungodly, may with the like reason deny that we
are created beings: for that which is done for a man without him,
may be done for him at any time which they that do it shall
appoint.&nbsp; While a man is a beggar, may not I make him worth
ten thousand a-year, if I can and will: and yet he may not know
thereof in that moment that I make him so? yet the revenue of
that estate shall really be his from the moment that I make him
so, and he shall know it too at the rent-day.</p>
<p>This is the case: we are sinners and ungodly; there is a
righteousness wrought out by Jesus Christ which God hath designed
we shall be made righteous by: and by it, if he will impute it to
us, we shall be righteous in his sight; even then when we are yet
ungodly in ourselves: for he justifies the ungodly.</p>
<p>Now, though it is irregular and blameworthy in man to justify
the wicked, because he cannot provide and clothe him with a
justifying righteousness, yet it is glorious, and for ever worthy
of praise, for God to do it: because it is in his power, not only
to forgive, but to make a man righteous, even then when he is a
sinner, and to justify him while he is ungodly.</p>
<p>But it may be yet objected, that though God has received
satisfaction for sin, and so sufficient terms of reconciliation
by the obedience and death of his Son, yet he imputeth it not
unto us, but upon condition of our becoming good.</p>
<p><i>Ans</i>.&nbsp; This must not be admitted: For,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The scripture saith not so; but that we are
reconciled to God by the death of his Son, and justified too, and
that while or when we are sinners and ungodly.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; If this objection carrieth truth in it, then it
follows that the Holy Ghost, faith, and so all grace, may be
given to us, and we may have it dwelling in us, yea, acting in
us, before we stand righteous in the judgment of the law before
God (for nothing can make us stand just before God in the
judgment of the law, but the obedience of the Son of God without
us.)&nbsp; And if the Holy Ghost, faith, and so, consequently,
the habit of every grace, may be in us, acting in us, before
Christ&rsquo;s righteousness be by God imputed to us, then we are
not justified as sinners and ungodly, but as persons inherently
holy and righteous before.</p>
<p>But I have shewed you that this cannot be, therefore
righteousness for justification must be imputed first.&nbsp; And
here let me present the reader with two or three things.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; That justification before God is one thing, and
justification to the understanding and conscience is
another.&nbsp; Now, I am treating of justification before God,
not of it as to man&rsquo;s understanding and conscience: and I
say, a man may be justified before God, even then when himself
knoweth nothing thereof; Isa. xl. 2; Mark ii. 5; and while he
hath not faith about it, but is ungodly.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; There is justification by faith, by faith&rsquo;s
applying of that righteousness to the understanding and
conscience, which God hath of his grace imputed for righteousness
to the soul for justification in his sight.&nbsp; And this is
that by which we, as to sense and feeling, have peace with God
&ldquo;Being justified by faith, we have peace with God, through
our Lord Jesus Christ;&rdquo; Rom. v. 1.&nbsp; And these two the
apostle keepeth distinct in the 10th verse: that &ldquo;while we
were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his
Son.&rdquo;&nbsp; He addeth, &ldquo;And not only so, but we joy
in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now
received the atonement,&rdquo; verse 11.&nbsp; Here you see, that
to be reconciled to God by the death of his Son is one thing, and
for us actually to receive by faith this reconciliation is
another: and not only so, but we have &ldquo;received the
atonement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Men do not gather their justification from
God&rsquo;s single act of imputing of righteousness, that we
might stand clear in his sight from the curse and judgment of the
law; but from the word of God, which they understand not till it
is brought to their understanding by the light and glory of the
Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>We are not, therefore, in the ministry of the word to
pronounce any man justified, from a supposition that God has
imputed righteousness to him (since that act is not known to us),
until the fruits that follow thereupon do break out before our
eyes; to wit, the signs and effects of the Holy Ghost indwelling
in our souls.&nbsp; And then we may conclude it, that is, that
such a one stands justified before God, yet not for the sake of
his inherent righteousness, nor yet for the fruits thereof, and
so not for the sake of the act of faith, but for the sake of
Jesus Christ his doing and suffering for us.</p>
<p>Nor will it avail to object, that if at first we stand
justified before God by his imputing of Christ&rsquo;s
righteousness unto us, though faith be not in us to act, we may
always stand justified so; and so what need of faith? for
therefore are we justified, first, by the imputation of God, as
we are ungodly, that thereby we may be made capable of receiving
the Holy Ghost and his graces in a way of righteousness and
justice.&nbsp; Besides, God will have those that he shall justify
by his grace through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ to
have the Holy Ghost, and so faith, that they may know and believe
the things not only that shall be, but that already are freely
given to us of God.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; says Paul, &ldquo;we
have received, not the spirit of the world but the Spirit which
is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to
us of God;&rdquo; 1 Cor. ii. 12.&nbsp; To know, that is, to
believe: it is given to you to believe, who believe according to
the working of his mighty power; &ldquo;And we have known and
believed the love that God hath to us,&rdquo; preceding to our
believing; John iv. 16.&nbsp; He then that is justified by
God&rsquo;s imputation, shall believe by the power of the Holy
Ghost; for that must come, and work faith, and strengthen the
soul to act it, because imputed righteousness has gone
before.&nbsp; He then that believeth shall be saved; for his
believing is a sign, not a cause, of his being made righteous
before God by imputation; and he that believeth not shall be
damned.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">And thus much for the Pharisee, and for
his information</span>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">And now I come
to that part of the text which remains, and which respecteth the
Publican</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Publican, standing afar off, would not lift up
so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast,
saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What this Publican was, I have shewed you, both with respect
to nation, office, and disposition.&nbsp; Wherefore I shall not
here trouble the reader as to that.&nbsp; We now, therefore, come
to his repentance in the whole and in the parts of it; concerning
which I shall take notice of several things, some more remote,
and some more near to the matter and life of it.</p>
<p>But, first, let us see how cross the Pharisee and the Publican
did lie in the temple one to another, while they both were
presenting of their prayers to God.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The Pharisee he goes in boldly, fears nothing, but
trusteth in himself that his state is good, that God loves him,
and that there was no doubt to be made but of his good speed in
this his religious enterprise.&nbsp; But, alas! poor Publican, he
sneaks, crawls into the temple, and when he comes there, stands
behind, aloof, off; as one not worthy to approach the divine
presence.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The Pharisee at his approach hath his mouth full of
many fine things, whereby he strokes himself over the head, and
in effect calls himself one of God&rsquo;s dear sons, that always
kept close to his will, abode with him, or, as the
prodigal&rsquo;s brother said, &ldquo;Lo, these many years do I
serve thee; neither transgressed I at any time thy
commandment;&rdquo; Luke xv. 29.&nbsp; But alas! poor Publican,
thy guilt, as to these pleas, stops thy mouth; thou hast not one
good thing to say of thyself, not one rag of righteousness; thy
conscience tells thee so; yea, and if thou shouldst now attempt
to set a good face on it, and for thy credit say something after
the Pharisee in way of thine own commendations, yet here is God
on the one side, the Pharisee on the other, together with thine
own heart, to give thee a check, to rebuke thee, to condemn thee,
and to lay thee even to the ground for thy insolence.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The Pharisee in his approach to God, wipes his
fingers of the Publican&rsquo;s enormities, will not come nigh
him, lest he should defile himself with his beastly rags:
&ldquo;I am not as other men are, nor yet as this
Publican.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the poor Publican, alas for him! his
fingers are not clean, nor can he tell how to make them so;
besides, he meekly and quietly puts up with this reflection of
the Pharisee upon him, and by silent behaviour justifies the
severe sentence of that self-righteous man, concluding with him,
that for his part he is wretched, and miserable, and poor, and
blind, and naked, and not worthy to come nigh, or to stand by, so
good, so virtuous, so holy, and so deserving a man as our
sparkling Pharisee is.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; The Pharisee, as at feasts and synagogues, chose the
chief and first place for his person, and for his prayer,
counting that the Publican was not meet, ought not to presume to
let his foul breath once come out of his polluted lips in the
temple, till <i>he</i> had made his holy prayer.&nbsp; And, poor
Publican, how dost thou hear and put up this with all other
affronts, counting even as the Pharisee counted of thee, that
thou wast but a dog in comparison of him, and therefore not fit
to go before, but to come as in chains, behind, and forbear to
present thy mournful supplication to the holy God, till he had
presented his, in his own conceit, brave, gay, and fine
oration?</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The Pharisee, as he is numerous in his repeating his
good deeds, so is he stiff in standing to them, bearing up
himself, that he hath now sufficient foundation on which to bear
up his soul against all the attempts of the law, the devil, sin,
and hell.&nbsp; But, alas, poor Publican! thou standest naked,
nay, worse than naked; for thou art clothed with filthy garments,
thy sins cover thy face with shame: nor hast thou in, or of
thyself, any defence from, or shelter against, the attempts,
assaults, and censures of thy spiritual enemies, but art now in
thine own eyes (though in the temple) cast forth into thine open
field stark-naked, to the loathing of thy person, as in the day
that thou wast born, and there ready to be devoured and torn in
pieces for thy transgressions against thy God.</p>
<p>What wilt thou do, Publican?&nbsp; What wilt thou do?&nbsp;
Come, let us see; which way wilt thou begin to address thyself to
God?&nbsp; Bethink thyself: hast thou any thing to say? speak
out, man: the Pharisee by this time has done, and received his
sentence: make an &ldquo;O yes;&rdquo; let all the world be
silent; yea, let the angels of heaven draw near and listen; for
the Publican is come to have to do with God! yea, is come from
the receipt of custom into the temple to pray to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Publican, standing afar off, would not lift up
so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast,
saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.&rdquo;&nbsp; And is this
thy way, poor Publican!&nbsp; O cunning sinner!&nbsp; O crafty
Publican! thy wisdom has outdone the Pharisee; for it is better
to apply ourselves to God&rsquo;s mercy than to trust to
ourselves that we are righteous.&nbsp; But that the Publican did
hit the mark, yea, get nearer unto, and more in the heart of God
and his Son than the Pharisee, the sequel will make manifest.</p>
<p>Take notice then of this profound speech of the Publican,
&ldquo;God be merciful to me a sinner.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yea, the Son
of God was so delighted with this prayer, that for the sake of
it, he even as a limner draweth out the Publican in his manner of
standing, behaviour, gestures, &amp;c., while he makes this
prayer to God: wherefore we will take notice both of the one and
of the other; for surely his gestures put lustre into his prayer
and repentance.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; His prayer you see is this, &ldquo;God be merciful to
me a sinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His gestures in his prayer were in general three.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; He &ldquo;stood afar off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; He &ldquo;would not lift up so much as his eyes to
heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; He &ldquo;smote upon his breast,&rdquo; with his
fist, saying, &ldquo;God be merciful to me a sinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To begin first with his prayer.&nbsp; In this prayer we have
two things to consider of.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; His confession: I am a sinner.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; His imploring of help against this malady: &ldquo;God
be merciful to me a sinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his confession divers things are to be taken notice
of.&nbsp; As&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The fairness and simplicity of his confession;
&ldquo;A sinner:&rdquo; I am a sinner; &ldquo;God be merciful to
me a sinner.&rdquo;&nbsp; This indeed he was, and this indeed he
confesses; and this, I say, he doth of godly simplicity.&nbsp;
For a man to confess himself a sinner, it is to speak all against
himself that can be spoken.&nbsp; And man, as degenerate, is too
much an hypocrite, and too much a self-flatterer, thus to confess
against himself, unless made simple and honest through the power
of conviction upon his heart.&nbsp; And it is worth your noting,
that he doth not say he was, or had been, but that at that time
his state was such, to wit, a sinner.&nbsp; &ldquo;God be
merciful to me a sinner,&rdquo; or who am, and now stand before
thee a sinner, in my sins.</p>
<p>Now, a little to shew you what it is to be a sinner; for every
one that sinneth may not in a proper sense be called a
sinner.&nbsp; Saints, the sanctified in Christ Jesus, do often
sin, but it is not proper to call them sinners: but here the
Publican calls himself a sinner; and therefore in effect calls
himself an evil tree, one that beareth no good fruit; one whose
body and soul is polluted, whose mind and conscience is defiled;
one who hath walked according to the course of this world, and
after the spirit that now worketh in the children of
disobedience: they having their minds at enmity against God, and
are taken captive by the devil at his will; a sinner, one whose
trade hath been in sin, and the works of Satan all his days.</p>
<p>Thus he waives all pleas, and stoops his neck immediately to
the block.&nbsp; Though he was a base man, yet he might have had
pleas; pleas, I say, as well as the Pharisee, though not so many,
yet as good.&nbsp; He was of the stock of Abraham, a Jew, an
Israelite of the Israelites, and so a privileged man in the
religion of the Jews, else what doth he do in the temple?&nbsp;
Yea, why did not the Pharisee, if he was a heathen, lay that to
his charge while he stood before God?&nbsp; But the truth is, he
could not; for the Publican was a Jew as well as the Pharisee,
and consequently might, had he been so disposed, have pleaded
that before God.&nbsp; But he would not, he could not, for his
conscience was under convictions, the awakenings of God were upon
him; wherefore his privileges melt away like grease, and fly from
him like the chaff of the summer threshing-floor, which the wind
taketh up and scattereth as the dust; he therefore lets all
privileges fall, and pleads only that he us a sinner.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; In this confession he judges and condemns himself:
For a man to say, I am a sinner, is as much as to say, I am
contrary to the holiness of God, a transgressor of the law, and
consequently an object of the curse, and an heir of hell.&nbsp;
The Publican, therefore, goeth very far in this his confession;
For,</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; In the third place, To confess that there is nothing
in him, done or can be done by him, that should allure, or
prevail with God to do any thing for him: for a sinner cannot do
good; no, not work up his heart unto one good thought: no, though
he should have heaven itself if he could, or was sure to burn in
hell-fire for ever and ever if he could not.&nbsp; For sin, where
it is in possession, and bears rule, as it doth in every one that
we may properly call a sinner, there it hath the mastery of the
man, hath bound up his senses in cords and chains, and made
nothing so odious to the soul as the things that are of the
Spirit of God.&nbsp; Wherefore it is said of such, that they are
&ldquo;Enemies in their minds;&rdquo; that &ldquo;The carnal mind
is enmity against God,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;Wickedness
proceedeth of the wicked;&rdquo; and that the Ethiopian may as
well change his skin, or the leopard his spots, as they that are
accustomed to do evil may learn to do well; Col. i.; Rom. viii.;
1 Sam. xxiv. 13; Jer. xiii. 23.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; In this confession he implicitly acknowledgeth that
sin is the worst of things, forasmuch as it layeth the soul out
of the reach of all remedy that can be found under heaven.&nbsp;
Nothing below or short of the mercy of God can deliver a poor
soul from this fearful malady.&nbsp; This the Pharisee did not
see.&nbsp; Doubtless he did conclude, that at some time or other
he had sinned; but he never in all his life did arrive to a sight
of what sin was: his knowledge of it was but false and
counterfeit, as is manifest by his cure; to wit, his own
righteousness.&nbsp; For take this for a truth undeniable, that
he that thinks himself better before God, because of his
reformations, never yet had the true knowledge of his sin: But
the poor Publican he had it, he had it in truth, as is manifest,
because it drives him to the only sovereign remedy.&nbsp; For
indeed, the right knowledge of sin, in the filth, and guilt, and
damning power thereof, makes a man to understand, that not any
thing but grace and mercy by Christ can secure him from the
hellish ruins thereof.</p>
<p>Suppose a man sick of an apoplexy unto death, and should for
his remedy make use only of those things that are good against
the second ague, would not this demonstrate that this man was not
sensible of the nature and danger of this disease?&nbsp; The same
may be said of every sinner that shall make use only of those
means to justify him before God, that can hardly make him go for
a good Christian before judicious men.&nbsp; But the poor
Publican, he knew the nature and the danger of his disease; and
knew also, that nothing but mercy, infinite mercy, could cure him
thereof.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; This confession of the Publican declareth, that he
himself was borne up now by an almighty though invisible
hand.&nbsp; For sin, when seen in its colours, and when appearing
in its monstrous shape, frighteth all away from God.&nbsp; This
is manifest by Cain, Judas, Saul, and others, who could not stand
up before God under the sense and appearance of their sin, but
fled before him, one to one fruit of despair, and one to
another.&nbsp; But now this Publican, though he apprehends his
sin, that himself was one that was a sinner, yet he beareth up,
cometh into the temple, approaches the presence of an holy and
sin-revenging God, stands before him, and confesses that he is
that man that sin had defiled, and that had brought him into the
danger of damnation thereby.</p>
<p>This therefore was a mighty act of the Publican.&nbsp; He went
against the voice of conscience, against sense and feeling,
against the curse and condemning verdict of the law: he went, as
I may say, upon hot burning coals to one that to sin and sinners
is a consuming fire.</p>
<p>Now then, did the Publican this of his own head, or from his
own mind?&nbsp; No, verily; there was some super-natural power
within that did secretly prompt him on, and strengthen him to
this more noble venture.&nbsp; True, there is nothing more common
among wicked men, than to trick and toy, and play with this
saying of the Publican, &ldquo;God be merciful to me a
sinner:&rdquo; not at all being sensible either what sin is, or
of their need of mercy.&nbsp; And such sinners shall find their
speed in the Publican&rsquo;s prayer far otherwise than the
Publican sped himself; it will happen unto them much as it
happened unto the vagabond Jews, exorcists, who took upon them to
call over them that had evil spirits, the name of the Lord Jesus;
that were beaten by that spirit, and made fly out of that house
naked and wounded, Acts xix. 13.&nbsp; Poor sinner, thou wilt say
the Publican&rsquo;s prayer, and make the Publican&rsquo;s
confession, and say, &ldquo;God be merciful to me a
sinner.&rdquo;&nbsp; But hold; dost thou do it with the
Publican&rsquo;s heart, sense, dread, and simplicity?&nbsp; If
not, thou dost but abuse the Publican and his prayer, and thyself
and his God; and shalt find God rejecting of thee and thy
prayers, saying, The Publican I know; his prayers and godly tears
I know; but who or what art thou? and will send thee away
naked.&nbsp; They are the hungry that he filleth with good
things, but the rich (and the senseless) he sendeth empty
away.</p>
<p>For my part, I find it one of the hardest things that I can
put my soul upon, even to come to God, when warmly sensible that
I am a sinner, for a share in grace and mercy.&nbsp; Oh! methinks
it seems to me as if the whole face of the heavens were set
against me.&nbsp; Yea, the very thought of God strikes me
through; I cannot bear up, I cannot stand before him; I cannot
but with a thousand tears say, &ldquo;God be merciful to me a
sinner;&rdquo; Ezra ix. 15.</p>
<p>At another time, when my heart is more hard and stupid, and
when his terror doth not make me afraid, then I can come before
him, and ask mercy at his hand, and scarce be sensible of sin or
grace, or that indeed I am before God.&nbsp; But above all, they
are the rare times, when I can go to God as the Publican,
sensible of his glorious majesty, sensible of my misery, and bear
up, and affectionately cry, &ldquo;God me merciful to me a
sinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But again, the Publican, by his confession, sheweth a piece of
the highest wisdom that a mortal man can shew; because; by so
doing, he engageth as well as imploreth the grace and mercy of
God to save him.&nbsp; You see by the text he imploreth it; and
now I will shew you that he engageth it, and makes himself a
sharer in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He that covereth his sins shall not prosper; but whoso
confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
again, &ldquo;If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all
unrighteousness;&rdquo; Prov. xxviii. 13; 1 John. i. 9.</p>
<p><i>First</i>, In the promise of pardon, &ldquo;he shall have
mercy;&rdquo; he shall have his sins forgiven.&nbsp; As also
Solomon prays, that God will forgive them that know their own
sores; and they are indeed such as are sensible of the plague of
their own heart, 2 Chron. vi. 29, 30; 1 Kings viii. 37, 38.&nbsp;
And the reason is, because the sinner is now driven to the
farthest point, for confession is the farthest point, and the
utmost bound unto which God has appointed the Publican to go,
with reference to his work; as it is said of Saul to David, when
he was about to give him Michal his daughter to wife, &ldquo;I
desire not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the
Philistines, to be avenged of the king&rsquo;s
enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So says God in this matter, I desire no sacrifices, nor legal
righteousness to make thee acceptable to me: &ldquo;Only
acknowledge and confess thine iniquity, that thou hast
transgressed against me,&rdquo; 1 Sam. xviii. 25; Jer. iii. 12,
13.&nbsp; And though this by some may be thought to be a very
easy way to come at, and partake of the mercy of God; yet let the
sensible sinner try it, and he shall find it one of the hardest
things in the world.&nbsp; And there are two things to which man
is prone, that makes confession hard:</p>
<p><i>First</i>, There is a great proneness in us to be partial,
and not thorough and plain in our confessions.&nbsp; We are apt
to make half confessions; to confess some, and hide some; or else
to make feigned confessions, flattering both ourselves, and also
God, while we make confession unto him; or else to confess sin,
as our own fancies apprehend, and not as the word descries
them.&nbsp; These things we are very prone to do; men can confess
little sins, while they hide great ones.&nbsp; Men can feign
themselves sorry for sin when they are not, or else in their
confessions forget to judge of sin by the word.&nbsp; Hence it is
said, They turned to God, &ldquo;not with their whole hearts, but
as it were feignedly.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They spake not aright,
saying, What have I done?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They flatter him
with their mouth, and lie unto him with their tongues,&rdquo; and
do their wickedness in the dark, and sin against him with a high
hand, and then come to him and &ldquo;cover the altar with their
tears.&rdquo;&nbsp; These things therefore demonstrate the
difficulty of sincere confession of sin; and that to do it as it
should, is no such easy thing.</p>
<p>To right confession of sin, several things must go: as,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; There must be sound conviction for sin upon the
spirit: for before a man shall be convinced of the nature,
aggravation, and evil of sin, how shall he make godly confession
of it?&nbsp; Now, to convince the soul of sin, the law must be
set home upon the conscience by the Spirit of God: &ldquo;For by
the law is the knowledge of sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again, &ldquo;I
had not known lust, unless the law had said, Thou shalt not
covet;&rdquo; Rom. vii. 7.&nbsp; This law, now when it
effectually ministereth conviction&mdash;of sin to the
conscience, doth it by putting of life, and strength, and terror
into sin.&nbsp; By its working on the conscience, it makes sin
revive, &ldquo;and the strength of sin is the law;&rdquo; Rom.
vii.; 1 Cor. xv.&nbsp; It also increaseth and multiplieth sin,
both by the revelation of God&rsquo;s anger against the soul, and
also by mustering up and calling to view sins committed and
forgotten time out of mind.&nbsp; Sin seen in the glass of the
law is a terrible thing; no man can behold it and live.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When the commandment came, sin revived, and I died;&rdquo;
when it came from God to my conscience, as managed by an almighty
arm, then it slew me.&nbsp; And now is the time to confess sin,
because now a soul knows what it is, and sees what it is, both in
the nature and consequence of it.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; To a right confession of sin, there must be sound
knowledge of God, especially as to his justice, holiness,
righteousness, and purity; wherefore the Publican here begins his
confession by calling upon or by the acknowledgement of his
Majesty: &ldquo;God be merciful to me a sinner:&rdquo;&nbsp; As
if he should say, God, O God, O great God, O sin-revenging God, I
have sinned against thee, I have broken thy law, I have opposed
thy holiness, thy justice, thy law, and thy righteous will.&nbsp;
O consuming fire (&ldquo;for our God is a consuming fire&rdquo;),
I have justly provoked thee to wrath, and to take vengeance on me
for my transgressions.&nbsp; But alas! how few that make
confession of sin have right apprehension of God, unto whom
confession of sin doth belong.&nbsp; Alas! it is easy for men to
entertain such apprehensions of God as shall please their own
humours, to bear up under the sense of sin, and that shall make
their confession rather facile and fantastical, than solid and
heartbreaking.&nbsp; The sight and knowledge of the great God is,
to sinful man, the most dreadful thing in the world; which makes
confession of sin so rare.&nbsp; Most men confess their sins
behind God&rsquo;s back, but few to his face; and you know there
is ofttimes a vast difference in thus doing among men.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; To the right confession of sin, there must be a deep
conviction of the terribleness of the day of judgment.&nbsp; This
John the Baptist inserts, where he insinuates, that the
Pharisees&rsquo; want of (sense of, and) the true confession of
sin; was because they had not been warned (or had not taken the
alarm) to flee from the wrath to come.&nbsp; What dread, terror,
or frightful apprehension can there be, where there is no sense
of a day of judgment, and of our giving unto God an account for
it?&nbsp; Matth. iii. 7; Luke iii. 7.</p>
<p>I say, therefore, to confession of sin, there must be,</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; A deep conviction of the certainty of the day of
judgment; namely, that such a day is coming, that such a day
shall be.&nbsp; This the apostle insinuates, where he saith,
&ldquo;God commandeth all men, every where, to repent: because he
hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in
righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath
given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the
dead;&rdquo; Acts xvii. 30, 31.</p>
<p>This will give a sense of what the soul must expect at that
day for sin, and so will drive to an hearty acknowledgement of
it, and strong cries for a deliverance from it.&nbsp; For thus
will the soul argue that expecteth the judgment-day, and that
believes that it must count for all.&nbsp; O my heart! it is in
vain now to dissemble, or to hide, or to lessen transgressions;
for there is a judgment to come, a day in which God will judge
the secrets of men by his Son; and at that day he will bring to
light the hidden things of darkness, and will manifest the
counsels of the heart.&nbsp; If it must be so then, to what end
will it be now to seek to dissemble? 1 Cor. iv. 5.&nbsp; This
also is in the Old Testament urged as an argument to cause youth,
and persons of all sizes, to recall themselves to sobriety, and
so to confession of their sin to God; where the Holy Ghost saith
ironically, &ldquo;Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth, and let
thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the
ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know
thou that for all these things God will bring thee into
judgment.&rdquo;&nbsp; So again, &ldquo;God shall bring every
work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good
or whether it be evil,&rdquo; Eccles. xi. 9; xii. 12, 14.</p>
<p>The certainty of this, I say, must go to the producing of
sincere confession of sin; and this is intimated by the Publican,
who within his confession, addeth, &ldquo;God be merciful to me a
sinner.&rdquo;&nbsp; As if he should say, If thou art not
merciful to me, thy judgment shall swallow me up: without thy
mercy I shall not stand, but fall by the judgment which thou hast
appointed.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; As there must be, for the producing of sincere
confession of sin, a deep conviction of the certainty, so of the
terribleness, of the day of judgment: wherefore the apostle, to
put men on repentance, which is sincere confession of sin, saith,
&ldquo;For we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ,
that every one may receive the things done in his body, according
to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.&nbsp; Knowing
therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men;&rdquo; 2 Cor.
v. 10, 11.&nbsp; The terror of the Lord, as we see here, he makes
use of, to persuade men to confession of sin, and repentance to
God for mercy.</p>
<p>And I am persuaded, that one reason that this day doth so
swarm with wanton professors, is, because they have not sound
conviction for, nor go to God with sincere confession of, sin:
and one cause of that has been, that they did never seriously
fall in with, nor yet sink under either the certainty or
terribleness, of the day of judgment.</p>
<p>O the terrors of the Lord! the amazing face that will be put
upon all things before the tribunal of God!&nbsp; Yea, the terror
that will then be read in the face of God, of Christ, of saints
and angels, against the ungodly!&nbsp; Whoso believes and
understands it, cannot live without confession of sin to God, and
a coming to him for mercy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mountains, fall upon us, and cover us, and hide us from
the face of him that sits upon the throne, and from the wrath of
the Lamb; for the great day of his wrath is come, and who is able
to stand?&rdquo;&nbsp; This terror is also signified, where it is
said, &ldquo;And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on
it, from whose face the (very) earth and the heaven fled away:
and there was found no place for them.&nbsp; And I saw the dead,
small and great, stand before God: and the books were opened; and
another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead
were judged out of those things which were written in the books,
according to their works.&nbsp; And the sea gave up the dead
which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which
were in them: and they were judged every man according to his
works.&nbsp; And death and hell were cast into the lake of
fire.&nbsp; This is the second death.&nbsp; And whosoever was not
found written in the book of life, was cast into the lake of
fire;&rdquo; Rev. xx.&nbsp; Here is terror; and this is revealed
in the word of God, that sinners might hear and consider it, and
so come and confess, and implore God&rsquo;s mercy.</p>
<p>The terror of the Lord, how will it appear, when he
&ldquo;shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, in
flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and
that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ!&rdquo;&nbsp; 2
Thess. i. 7&ndash;9.</p>
<p>The terror of the Lord, how will it appear, when his wrath
shall burn and flame out like an oven or a fiery furnace before
him, while the wicked stand in his sight!&nbsp; Matt. xiii.
50.</p>
<p>The terror of the Lord, how will it appear, while the angels
at his command shall gather the wicked to burn them!&nbsp;
&ldquo;As the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, so shall
it be in the end of this world.&nbsp; The Son of man shall send
forth his angels, and they shall gather together out of his
kingdom all things that offend, and them that do iniquity, and
shall cast them into a furnace of fire, where there shall be
wailing and gnashing of teeth;&rdquo; Matt. xiii.
40&ndash;42.&nbsp; Who can conceive this terror! much more unable
are men to express it with tongue or pen; yet the truly penitent
and sin-confessing Publican hath apprehension so far thereof, by
the word of the testimony, that it driveth him to God with a
confession of sin for an interest in God&rsquo;s mercy.&nbsp;
But,</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; To right and sincere confession of sin there must be
a conviction of a probability of mercy.&nbsp; This also is
intimated by the Publican in his confession; &ldquo;God (saith
he) be merciful to me a sinner.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had some
glimmerings of mercy, some conviction of a probability of mercy,
or that he might obtain mercy for his pardon, if he went and with
unfeigned lips did confess his sins to God.</p>
<p>Despair of mercy shuts up the mouth, makes the heart hard, and
drives a man away from God; as is manifest in the case of Adam
and the fallen angels.&nbsp; But the least intimation of mercy,
if the heart can but touch, feel, taste, or have the least
probability of it, that will open the mouth, tend to soften the
heart, and to make a very publican come up to God into the
temple, and say, &ldquo;God be merciful to me a
sinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There must then be this holy mixture of things in the heart of
a truly confessing publican.&nbsp; There must be sound sense of
sin, sound knowledge of God, deep conviction of the certainty and
terribleness of the day of judgment, as also of the probability
of obtaining mercy.&nbsp; But to come to that which remains; I
told you that there were two things that did make unfeigned
confession hard.&nbsp; The first I have touched upon.</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, And now the second follows: and that is, some
private leaning to some goodness a man shall conceit that he hath
done before, or is doing now, or that he purposeth to prevail
with God for the pardon of sins.&nbsp; This man, to be sure,
knows not sin in the nature and evil of it, only he has some
false apprehensions about it.&nbsp; For where the right knowledge
of sin is in the heart, that man sees so much evil in the least
transgressions, as that it would break the back of all the angels
of heaven should the great God impute it to them.&nbsp; And he
that sees this is far enough off from thinking of doing to
mitigate or assuage the rigour of the law, or to make pardonable
his own transgressions thereby.&nbsp; But he that sees not this,
cannot confess his transgressions aright; for true confession
consisteth in the general, in a man&rsquo;s taking to himself his
transgressions, with the acknowledgment of them to be his, and
that he cannot stir from under them, nor do anything to make
amends for them, or to palliate the rigour of justice against the
soul.&nbsp; And this the Publican did when he cried, &ldquo;God
be merciful to me a sinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made his sins his own; he stood before God in them,
accounting that he was surely undone for ever, if God did not
extend forgiveness unto him.&nbsp; And this is to do as the
prophet Jeremiah bids; to wit, only to acknowledge our
iniquities, to acknowledge them at the terrible bar of
God&rsquo;s justice, until mercy takes them out of the way; not
by doing, or promising to do, either this or that good
work.&nbsp; And the reason of this kind of confession is,</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; Because this carrieth in it the true nature of
confession; to confess, and plead for mercy under the crimes
confessed, without shifts and evasions, is the only real simple
way of confession.&nbsp; &ldquo;I said, I will confess my
transgressions to the Lord;&rdquo; and what then? &ldquo;and thou
forgavest the iniquity of my sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mark, nothing
comes in betwixt confession and forgiveness of sin, Psalm xxxii.
5; nothing of works of righteousness, nothing of legal
amendments, nothing but an outcry for mercy; and that act is so
far off from lessening the offence, that it greatly heightens and
aggravates it.&nbsp; That is the first reason.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; A second reason is, Because God doth expect that
the penitent confessors should not only confess, but bear their
shame on them: yea, saith God, &ldquo;Be thou confounded also,
and bear thine own shame:&rdquo; when God takes away thine
iniquity, thou shalt &ldquo;be confounded, and never open thy
mouth more, because of thy shame;&rdquo; Ezek. xvi. 52, 54, 62,
63.&nbsp; We count it convenient that men, when their crimes and
transgressions are to be manifested, that they be set in some
open place with a piece paper, wherein their transgressions are
inserted, that they may not only confess, but bear their own
shame.&nbsp; At the penitential confession of sinners God has
something to do; if not before men, yet before angels, that they
may behold, and be affected, and rejoice when they shall see,
after the revelation of sin, the sinner taken into the favour and
abundant mercy of God; Luke xv.</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; A third reason is, for that God will, in the
forgiveness of sin, magnify the riches of his mercy; but this
cannot be, if God shall suffer, or accept of such confession of
sin, as is yet intermixed with those things that will darken the
heinousness of the offence.</p>
<p>That God, in the salvation, and so in the confession, of the
sinner, designs the magnifying of his mercy, is apparent enough
from the whole current of scripture; and that any of the things
now mentioned will, if suffered to be done, darken and eclipse
this thing, is evident to reason itself.</p>
<p>Suppose a man stand indicted for treason, yet shall so order
the matter that it shall ring in the country that his offences
are but petty crimes; though the king shall forgive the man, much
glory shall not thereby redound to the riches and greatness of
his mercy.&nbsp; But let all things lie naked, let nothing lie
hid or covered, let sin be seen, shewn, and confessed, as it is
in the sinner himself, and then there will be in his forgiveness
a magnifying of mercy.</p>
<p>(4.)&nbsp; A fourth reason is, for else God cannot be
justified in his sayings, nor overcome when he is judged; Psalm
li.; Rom. iii.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s word hath told us what sin is,
both as to its nature and evil effects; God&rsquo;s word hath
told us, that the best of our righteousness is no better than
filthy rags.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s word has also told us, that sin is
forgiven us freely by grace, and not for the sake of our
amendments: and all this God shews, not only in the acts of his
mercy toward, but even in the humiliations and confessions of,
the penitent; for God will have his mercy to be displayed even
there where the sinner hath taken his first step toward him:
&ldquo;That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so grace might
reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our
Lord;&rdquo; Rom. v. 21.</p>
<p>(5.)&nbsp; A fifth reason is, because God would have by the
Publican&rsquo;s conversion others affected with the displays and
discoveries of wonderful grace, but not to cloud and cover it
with lessening of sin.</p>
<p>For what will such say when sin begins to appear to
conscience, and when the law shall follow it with a voice of
words, each one like a clap of thunder?&nbsp; I say, what will
such say, when they shall read that the Publican did only
acknowledge his iniquity, and found grace and favour of
God?&nbsp; That God is infinitely merciful to those or to such as
in truth stand in need of mercy.&nbsp; Also, that he sheweth
mercy of his own good pleasure, nothing moving him thereto.</p>
<p>I say, this is the way to make others be affected with mercy,
as he saith, by the apostle Paul, &ldquo;But God, who is rich in
mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we
were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ (by
grace ye are saved); and hath raised us up together, and made us
sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus; that in the ages
to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his
kindness to us-ward (or toward us) through Christ Jesus;&rdquo;
Eph. ii. 4&ndash;7.&nbsp; You may also see that 1 Tim. i. 15,
16.</p>
<p>(6.)&nbsp; Another reason of this is, because this is the way
to heighten the comfort and consolation of the soul, and that
both here and hereafter.&nbsp; What tendeth more to this, than
for sinners to see, and with guilt and amazement to confess, what
sin is, and so to have pardon extended from God to the sinner as
such?&nbsp; This fills the heart; it ravishes the soul; puts joy
into the thoughts of salvation from sin, and deliverance from
wrath to come.&nbsp; Now they &ldquo;return, and comb to Zion
with songs, and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall
obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee
away;&rdquo; Isa. xxxv. 10.&nbsp; Indeed, the belief of this
makes joy and gladness endless.</p>
<p>(7.)&nbsp; Besides, it layeth upon the soul the greatest
obligations to holiness.&nbsp; What like the apprehension of free
forgiveness (and that apprehension must come in through a sight
of the greatness of sin, and of inability to do any thing towards
satisfaction), to engage the heart of a rebel to love his prince,
and to submit to his laws?</p>
<p>When Elisha had taken the Syrian captives, some were for using
severities towards them; but he said, &ldquo;Set bread and water
before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their
master;&rdquo; and they did so.&nbsp; And what follows?&nbsp;
&ldquo;So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of
Israel,&rdquo;&mdash;he conquered their malice with his
compassion.&nbsp; And it is the love of Christ that constraineth
to live to him; 2 Kings vi. 13&ndash;23; 2 Cor. v. 14.</p>
<p>Many other things might possibly be urged, but at present let
these be sufficient.</p>
<p>The <span class="GutSmall">SECOND</span> thing that we made
mention of in the Publican&rsquo;s prayer, was an imploring of
help against this malady: &ldquo;God be merciful to me a
sinner.&rdquo;&nbsp; In which petition I shall take notice of
several things.</p>
<p><i>First</i>, That a man&rsquo;s help against sin doth not so
absolutely lie in his personal conquest as in the pardon of
them.&nbsp; I suppose a conquest, though there can indeed by man
be none so long as he liveth in this world, I mean, a complete
conquest and annihilation of sin.</p>
<p>The Publican, and so every graciously awakened sinner, is
doubtless for the subduing of sin; but yet he looketh that the
chief help against it doth lie in the pardon of it.&nbsp; Suppose
a man should stab his neighbour with his knife, and afterwards
burn his knife to nothing in the fire, would this give him help
against his murder?&nbsp; No, verily, nothwithstanding this, his
neck is obnoxious to the halter, yea, and his soul to
hell-fire.&nbsp; But a pardon gives him absolute help: It is God
that justifies; who shall condemn?&nbsp; Rom. viii.&nbsp; Suppose
a man should live many days in rebellion against God, and after
that leave off to live any longer so rebelliously, would this
help him against the guilt which he had contracted before?&nbsp;
No, verily; without remission there is no help, but the rebel is
undone.&nbsp; Wherefore the first blessedness, yea, and that
without which all other things cannot make one blessed, it lies
in pardon.&nbsp; &ldquo;Blessed is he whose transgression is
forgiven, whose sin is covered.&nbsp; Blessed is the man unto
whom the Lord will not impute sin;&rdquo; Psalm xxxii.; Rom.
iv.</p>
<p>Suppose a man greatly sanctified and made holy; I say, suppose
it: yet if the sins before committed by him be not pardoned, he
cannot be a blessed man.</p>
<p>Yet again, suppose a man should be caught up to heaven, not
having his sins pardoned; heaven itself cannot make him a blessed
man.&nbsp; I suppose these things&mdash;not that they can
be&mdash;to illustrate my matter.&nbsp; There can be no
blessedness upon any man who yet remaineth unforgiven.&nbsp; You
see therefore here, that there was much of the wisdom of the Holy
Ghost in this prayer of the Publican.&nbsp; He was directed the
right, the only, the next way to shelter, where blessedness
begins, even to mercy for the pardon of his sins.&nbsp; Alas!
what would it advantage a traitor to be taken up into the
king&rsquo;s coach, to be clothed with the king&rsquo;s royal
robe, to have put upon his finger the king&rsquo;s gold ring, and
to be made to wear, for the present, a chain of gold about his
neck, if after all this the king should say unto him, But I will
not pardon thy rebellion; thou shalt die for thy treason?&nbsp;
Pardon, then, to him that loves life, is better, and more to be
preferred and sought after, than all other things; yea, it is the
highest wisdom in any sinner to seek after that first.</p>
<p>This therefore confuteth the blindness of some, and the
hypocrisy of others.&nbsp; Some are so silly and so blind as
quite to forget and look over the pardon of sin, and to lay their
happiness in some external amendments, when, alas! poor wretches
as they are, they abide under the wrath of God.&nbsp; Or if they
be not quite so foolish as utterly to forget the forgiveness of
sin, yet they think of it but in the second place; they are for
setting of sanctification before justification, and so seek to
confound the order of God; and that which is worse unto them,
they by so doing do what they can to keep themselves indeed from
being sharers in that great blessing of forgiveness of sins by
grace.</p>
<p>But the Publican here was guided by the wisdom of
heaven.&nbsp; He comes into the temple, he confesseth himself a
sinner, and forthwith, without any delay, before he removeth his
foot from where he stands, craves help of pardon; for he knew
that all other things, if he remained in guilt, would not help
him against that damnation that belonged to a vile and unforgiven
sinner.</p>
<p>This also confuteth the hypocrites, such as is our Pharisee
here in the text, that glory in nothing so much as that they are
not as other men, not unjust, no adulterer, no extortioner, nor
even as this Publican; and thus miss of the forgiveness of sin;
and if they have missed of the beginning good, they shall never,
as so standing, receive the second or the third.&nbsp;
Justification, sanctification, glorification, they are the three
things, but the order of God must not be perverted.&nbsp;
Justification must be first, because that comes to man while he
is ungodly and a sinner.</p>
<p>Justification cannot be where God has not passed a
pardon.&nbsp; A pardon, then, is the first thing to be looked
after by the sinner.&nbsp; This the Pharisee did not; therefore
he went down to his house unjustified; he set the stumbling-block
of his iniquity before his face when he went to inquire of the
Lord; and as he neglected, slighted, scorned, because he thought
that he had no need of pardon, therefore it was given to the
poor, needy, and miserable Publican, and he went away with the
blessing.</p>
<p>Publicans, since this is so weighty a point, let me exhort you
that you do not forget this prayer of your wise and elder
brother, to wit, the Publican that went up into the temple to
pray.&nbsp; I say, forget it not, neither suffer any
vain-glorious or self-conceited hypocrites with argument to
allure you with their silly and deceitful tongues from this
wholesome doctrine.&nbsp; Remember that you are sinners as
abominable as the Publican, wherefore do you, as you have him for
your pattern, go to God, confess, in all simple, honest, and
self-abasing, your numerous and abominable sins; and be sure that
in the very next place you forget not to ask for pardon, saying,
&ldquo;God be merciful to me a sinner.&rdquo;&nbsp; And remember
that none but God can help you against, nor keep you from, the
damnation and misery that comes by sin.</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, As the Publican imploreth help, so
notwithstanding the sentence of the law that is gone out against
him, he saith to God, Be merciful to me: and also in that he
concludes himself a sinner.&nbsp; I say, he justifieth, he
approveth of the sentence of the law, that was now gone out
against him, and by which he now stood condemned in his own
conscience before the tribunal of God&rsquo;s justice.&nbsp; He
saith not as the hypocrite, Because I am innocent, surely his
anger shall turn from me; or, What have we spoken so much against
thee?&nbsp; No, he is none of these murmurs or complainers, but
fairly falls before the law, witnesses, judge, and jury, and
consenteth to the verdict, sentence, and testimony of each of
them; Jer. ii. 36; Mal. ii. 13.</p>
<p>To illustrate this a little, suppose a malefactor should be
arraigned before a judge, and that after the witnesses, jury, and
judge, have all condemned him to death for his fact, the judge
again should ask, him what he can say for himself why sentence of
death should not pass upon him?&nbsp; Now, if he saith, Nothing,
but good my lord, mercy; he confesseth the indictment, approveth
of the verdict of the jury, and consenteth to the judgment of the
judge.</p>
<p>The Publican therefore in crying, Mercy, justifieth the
sentence of the law that was gone out against his sins.&nbsp; He
wrangleth not with the law, saying, that was too severe; though
many men do thus, saying, &ldquo;God forbid; for then woe be to
us.&rdquo;&nbsp; He wrangleth not with the witness, which was his
own conscience; though some will buffet, smite, and stop its
mouth, or command it to be silent.&nbsp; He wrangleth not with
the jury, which were the prophets and apostles; though some men
cannot abide to hear all that they say.&nbsp; He wrangleth not
with the judge, nor sheweth himself irreverently before him; but
in all humble gestures that could bespeak him acquiescing with
the sentence, he flieth to mercy for relief.</p>
<p>Nor is this alone the way of the Publican; but of other godly
men before his time.&nbsp; When David was condemned, he justified
the sentence and the judge, out of whose mouth it proceeded, and
so fled for succour to the mercy of God; Psalm li.&nbsp; When
Shemaiah the prophet pronounced God&rsquo;s judgments against the
princes of Judah for their sin, they said, &ldquo;The Lord is
righteous.&rdquo;&nbsp; When the church in the Lamentations had
reckoned up several of her grievous afflictions wherewith she had
been chastised, she, instead of complaining, doth justify the
Lord, and approve of the sentence that was passed upon her,
saying, &ldquo;The Lord is righteous; for I have rebelled against
his commandment.&rdquo;&nbsp; So Daniel, after he had enumerated
the evils that befel the church in his day, addeth,
&ldquo;Therefore hath the Lord brought it upon us; for the Lord
our God is righteous in all his works which he doth: for we
obeyed not his voice;&rdquo; 2 Chron. xii. 6, Lam. i. 18; Dan.
ix. 14.</p>
<p>And this is the case with our Publican.&nbsp; He has
transgressed a law that is holy, just, and good: the witness that
accuseth him of this is God and his conscience; he is also cast
by the verdict of holy men; and all this he knows, and implicitly
confesses, even in that he directs his prayer unto his judge for
pardon.&nbsp; And it is one of the excellentest sights in the
world, to see or understand a sinner thus honestly receiving the
sentence of the law that is gone out against him; to see and hear
a Publican thus to justify God.&nbsp; And this God would have men
do for these reasons.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; That it might be conspicuous to all that the Publican
has need of mercy.&nbsp; This is for the glory of the justice of
God, because it vindicates it in its goings out against the
Publican.&nbsp; God loveth to do things in justice and
righteousness, when he goeth out against men, though it be but
such a going out against them as only tendeth to their conviction
and conversion.&nbsp; When he dealt with our father Abraham in
this matter, he called him to his foot, as here he doth the
Publican.&nbsp; And, sinner, if God counts thee worthy to inherit
the throne of glory, he will bring thee hither.&nbsp; But,</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The Publican, by the power of conviction, stoops to,
and falleth under, the righteous sentence gone forth against him,
that it might be also manifest, that what afterward he shall
receive is of the mere grace and sovereign goodness of God.&nbsp;
And indeed there is no way that doth more naturally tend to make
this manifest than this.&nbsp; For thus; there is a man proceeded
against for life by the law, and the sentence of death is, in
conclusion, most justly and righteously passed upon him by the
judge.&nbsp; Suppose now, that after this, this man lives, and is
exalted to honour, enjoys great things, and is put into place of
trust and power, and that by him that he has offended, even by
him that did pass the sentence upon him.</p>
<p>What will all say, or what will they conclude, even upon the
very first hearing of this story?&nbsp; Will they not
say,&mdash;Well, whoever he was that found himself wrapped up in
this strange providence, must thank the mercy of a gracious
prince; for all these things bespeak grace and favour.&nbsp;
But,</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; As the Publican falleth willingly under the sentence,
and justifieth the passing of it upon him; so by his flying to
mercy for help, he declareth to all that he cannot deliver
himself: he putteth help away from himself, or saith, It is not
in me.</p>
<p>This, I say, is another thing included in this prayer, and it
is a thing distinct from that.&nbsp; For it is possible for a man
to justify, and fall under, the sentence of the judge, and yet
retain that with himself that will certainly deliver him from
that sentence when it has done its worst.&nbsp; Many have held up
their hand, and cried Guilty, at the bar, and yet have fetched
themselves off for all that; but then they have not pleaded mercy
(for he that doth so, puts his life altogether into the hands of
another), but privilege or good deeds, either done or to be done
by them.&nbsp; But the Publican in our text puts all out of his
own hand; and in effect saith to that God before whom he went up
into the temple to pray, Lord, I stand here condemned at the bar
of thy justice, and that worthily, for the sentence is good, and
hath in righteousness gone out against me: nor can I deliver
myself: I heartily and freely confess I cannot; wherefore I
betake myself only to thy mercy, and do pray thee to forgive the
transgressions of me a sinner.&nbsp; O how few be there of such
kind of publicans, I mean of publicans thus made sensible, that
come unto God for mercy!</p>
<p>Mercy, with most, is rather a compliment, I mean while they
plead it with God, than a matter of absolute necessity; they have
not awfully, and in judgment and conscience, fallen under the
sentence, nor put themselves out of all plea but the plea of
mercy; indeed, thus to do is the effect of the proof of the
vanity and emptiness of all experiments made use of before.</p>
<p>Now, there is a twofold proof of experiments; the one is the
result of practice, the other is the result of faith.</p>
<p>The woman with her bloody issue made her proof by practice,
when she had spent all that she had upon physicians, and was
nothing bettered, but rather grew worse; Mark v.&nbsp; But our
Publican here proves the emptiness and vanity of any other helps,
by one cast of faith upon the contents of the Bible, and by
another look upon his present state of condemnation; wherefore he
presently, without any more ado, condemneth all other helps,
ways, modes, or means of deliverance, and betakes himself only to
the mercy of God: saying, &ldquo;God be merciful to me a
sinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And herein he sheweth wonderful wisdom.&nbsp; For,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; By this he thrusts himself under the shelter and
blessing of the promise; and I am sure it is better and safer to
do so, than to rely upon the best of excellencies that this world
can afford: Hos. xiv. 1&ndash;3.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; He takes the ready way to please God: for God takes
more delight in shewing of mercy than in any thing that we can
do; Hos. vi. 6; Matt. ix. 13; xii. 7.&nbsp; Yea, and that also is
the man that pleaseth him, even he that hopes in his mercy; Psalm
cxlvii. 11.&nbsp; The Publican, therefore, whatever the Pharisee
might think, stood all this while upon sure ground, and had by
far the start of him for heaven.&nbsp; Alas! his dull head could
look no further than to the conceit of the pitiful beauty and
splendour of his own filthy righteousness.&nbsp; Nor durst he
leave that to trust wholly to the mercy of God; but the Publican
comes out, though in his sins, yet like an awakened, enlightened,
resolved man, and first abases himself, then gives God the glory
of his justice, and after that the glory of his mercy, by saying,
&ldquo;God be merciful to me a sinner;&rdquo; and thus in the
ears of the angels he did ring the changes of heaven.&nbsp;
And,</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The Publican, in his thus putting himself upon mercy,
sheweth, that in his opinion there is more virtue in mercy to
save, than there is in the law and sin to condemn.&nbsp; And
although this is not counted a great matter to do, while men are
far from the law, and while their conscience is asleep within
them; yet when the law comes near, and conscience is awake, who
so tries it will find it a laborious work.&nbsp; Cain could not
do thus for his heart, no, nor Saul; nor Judas either.&nbsp; This
is another kind of thing than most men think it to be, or shall
find it, whenever they shall behold God&rsquo;s angry face, and
when they shall hear the words of his law.</p>
<p>However, our Publican did it, and ventured his body, soul, and
future condition for ever on this bottom with other the saints
and servants of God, leaving the world to swim over the sea of
God&rsquo;s wrath (if they will) in their weak and simple vessels
of bulrushes, or to lean upon their cobweb-hold, when he shall
arise to the judgment that he hath appointed.</p>
<p>In the mean time, pray God awaken us as he did the Publican;
pray God enlighten us as he did the Publican; pray God grant us
boldness to come to him as the Publican did; and also in that
trembling spirit as he did, when he cried in the temple before
him, &ldquo;God be merciful to me a sinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus having passed over his prayer, we come in the next place
to his <span class="GutSmall">GESTURES</span>; for in my judgment
the right understanding of them will give us yet more conviction
of the Publican&rsquo;s sense and awakening of spirit under this
present action of his.</p>
<p>And I have observed many a poor wretch that hath readily had
recourse to the Publican&rsquo;s prayer, that never knew what the
Publican&rsquo;s gestures, in the presence of God, while in
prayer before him, did mean.&nbsp; Nor must any man be admitted
to think, that those gestures of his were a custom, and a
formality among the Jews in those days; for it is evident enough
by the carriage of the Pharisee, that it was below them and their
mode, when they came into the temple, or when they prayed any
where else; and they in those days were counted for the best of
men; and in religious matters men were to imitate and take their
examples at the hands of the best, not at the hands of the
worst.</p>
<p>The Publican&rsquo;s gestures then were properly his own;
caused by the guilt of sin, and by that dread of the majesty of
God that was upon his spirit.&nbsp; And a comely posture it was,
else Christ Jesus, the Son of God, would never have taken that
particular notice thereof as he did, nor have smiled upon it so
much as to take, and distinctly repeat it, as that which made his
prayer the more weighty, also to be taken notice of.&nbsp; Yea,
in my opinion, the Lord Jesus committed it to record, for that he
liked it, and for that it will pass for some kind of touchstone
of prayer that is made in good sense of sin and of God, and of
need of his goodness and mercy.&nbsp; For verily, all these
postures signify sense, sight of a lost condition, and a heart in
good earnest for mercy.</p>
<p>I know that they may be counterfeited, and Christ Jesus knows
who doth so too; but that will not hinder, or make weak or
invalid what hath already been spoken about it.&nbsp; But to
forbear to make a further prologue, and to come to the handling
of particulars:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Publican standing afar off, would not lift up
so much as his eyes to heaven, but smote upon his breast,&rdquo;
&amp;c.</p>
<p>Three things, as I told you already, we may perceive in these
words, by which his publican posture or gestures are set
forth.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; He stands &ldquo;afar off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; He &ldquo;would not lift up so much as his eyes to
heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; He &ldquo;smote upon his breast,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>For the first of these, He stood afar off.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
the Publican standing afar off.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is, I say, the
first thing, the first posture of his with which we are
acquainted, and it informeth us of several things.</p>
<p><i>First</i>, That he came not with senselessness of the
majesty of God when he came to pray, as the Pharisee did, and as
sinners commonly do.&nbsp; For this standing back, or afar off,
declares, that the majesty of God had an awe upon his spirit; he
saw whither, to whom, and for what, he was now approaching the
temple.&nbsp; It is said in the 20th of Exodus, that when the
people saw the thunderings and lightnings, and the noise of the
trumpet, and the mountain smoking (and all these were signs of
God&rsquo;s terrible presence and dreadful majesty), they removed
themselves, and &ldquo;stood afar off;&rdquo; Exod. xx. 18.&nbsp;
This behaviour, therefore, of the Publican did well become his
present action, especially since, in his own eyes, he was yet an
unforgiven sinner.&nbsp; Alas! what is God&rsquo;s majesty to a
sinful man but a consuming fire?&nbsp; And what is a sinful man
in himself, or in his approach to God, but as stubble fully
dry?</p>
<p>How then could the Publican do otherwise (than what he did)
than stand afar off if he either thought of God or himself?&nbsp;
Indeed the people afore named, before they saw God in his
terrible majesty, could scarcely be kept off from the mount with
words and bounds, as it is now the case of many: their blindness
gives them boldness; their rudeness gives them confidence; but
when they shall see what the Publican saw, and felt, and
understood, as he, they will pray and stand afar off even as
these people did.&nbsp; They removed and stood afar off, and then
fell to praying of Moses, that this dreadful sight and sound
might be taken from them.&nbsp; And what if I should say, he
stood afar off for fear of a blow, though he came for mercy, as
it is said of them, &ldquo;They stood afar off for fear of her
torments;&rdquo; Rev. xviii. 10, 18.</p>
<p>I know what it is to go to God for mercy, and stand all that
while through fear afar off; being possessed with this, will not
God now smite me at once to the ground for my sins?&nbsp; David
thought something when he said as he prayed, &ldquo;Cast me not
away from thy presence; and take not thy Holy Spirit from
me;&rdquo; Psalm li. 11.</p>
<p>There is none knows, but those that have them, what turns and
returns, what coming on and going off, there is in the spirit of
a man that indeed is awakened, and that stands awakened before
the glorious Majesty in prayer.&nbsp; The prodigal also made his
prayer to his Father intentionally, while he was yet a great way
off.&nbsp; And so did the lepers too: &ldquo;And as he entered
into a certain village there met him ten men that were lepers,
which stood afar off: and they lifted up their voices and said,
Jesus, Master, have mercy on us;&rdquo; Luke xvii. 12, 13.</p>
<p>See here, it has been the custom of praying men to keep their
distance, and not to be rudely bold in rushing into the presence
of the holy and heavenly Majesty, especially if they have been
sensible of their own vileness and sins, as the prodigal, the
lepers, and our poor Publican was.&nbsp; Yea, Peter himself, when
upon a time he perceived more than commonly he did of the majesty
of Jesus his Lord, what doth he do?&nbsp; &ldquo;When Simon Peter
saw it (says the text), he fell down at Jesus&rsquo; knees,
saying, Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord;&rdquo;
Luke v. 3&ndash;8.&nbsp; Oh! when men see God and themselves, it
fills them with holy fear of the greatness of the majesty of God,
as well as with love to, and desire after, his mercy.</p>
<p>Besides, by his standing afar off, it might be to intimate
that he now had in mind, and with great weight upon his
conscience, the infinite distance that was betwixt God and
him.&nbsp; Men should know that, and tremble in the thoughts of
it, when they are about to approach the omnipotent presence.</p>
<p>What is poor sorry man, poor dust and ashes, that he should
crowd it up, and go jostlingly into the presence of the great
God&mdash;especially since it is apparent the disproportion that
is betwixt God and him?&nbsp; Esther, when she went to supplicate
the king her husband for her people, made use neither of her
beauty nor relation, nor the privileges of which she might have
had temptation to make use of, especially at such a time, and in
such exigencies, as then did compass her about; but, I say, she
made not use of them to thrust herself into his presence, but
knew, and kept her distance, standing in the inward court of his
palace until he held out the golden sceptre to her; then Esther
drew near, and touched the top thereof; Esth. v. 1, 2.</p>
<p>Men, also, when they come into the presence of God, should
know their distance; yea, and shew that they know it too, by such
gestures, and carriages, and behaviour, that are seemly.&nbsp; A
remarkable saying is that of Solomon, &ldquo;Keep thy
foot,&rdquo; saith he, &ldquo;when thou goest into the house of
God, and be more ready to hear than to give the sacrifice of
fools; for they consider not that they do evil.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
as they should keep their foot, so also he adds, &ldquo;Be not
rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter
any thing before God; for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth,
therefore let thy words be few;&rdquo; Eccles. v. 1, 2.</p>
<p>Three things the Holy Ghost exhorteth to in this text.</p>
<p>The one is, That we look to our feet, and not be forward to
crowd into God&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>Another is, That we should also look well to our tongues, that
they be not rash in uttering any thing before God.</p>
<p>And the third is, Because of the infinite distance that is
betwixt God and us, which is intimated by these words, &ldquo;For
God is in heaven, and thou upon earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Publican therefore shewed great wisdom, holy shame, and
humility, in this brave gesture of his, namely, in his standing
afar off when he went up into the temple to pray.&nbsp; But this
is not all.</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, The Publican, in standing afar off, left room
for an Advocate and high-priest, a Day&rsquo;s-man, to come
betwixt, to make peace between God and his poor creature.&nbsp;
Moses, the great mediator of the Old Testament, was to go nigher
to God than the rest of the elders, or those of the people; Exod.
xx. 21.&nbsp; Yea, the rest of the people were expressly
commanded to worship, &ldquo;standing afar off.&rdquo;&nbsp; No
man of the sons of Aaron that had a blemish was to come
nigh.&nbsp; &ldquo;No man that hath a blemish of the seed of
Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the
Lord made by fire.&nbsp; He shall not come nigh to offer the
bread of his God;&rdquo; Lev. xxi. 21.</p>
<p>The Publican durst not be his own mediator; he knew he had a
blemish, and was infirm, and therefore he stands back; for he
knew that it was none of him that his God had chosen to come near
unto him, to offer &ldquo;the fat and the blood;&rdquo; Ezek.
xliv. 13&ndash;15.&nbsp; The Publican, therefore, was thus far
right; he took not up the room himself, neither with his person
nor his performances, but stood back, and gave place to the
High-priest that was to be intercessor.</p>
<p>We read, that when Zacharias went into the temple to burn
incense, as at the time his lot was, &ldquo;The whole multitude
of the people were praying without;&rdquo; Luke i. 9, 10.&nbsp;
They left him where he was, near to God, between God and them,
mediating for them; for the offering of incense by the
chief-priest was a figurative making of intercession for the
people, and they maintained their distance.</p>
<p>It is a great matter in praying to God, not to go too far, nor
come too short, in that duty, I mean in the duty of prayer; and a
man is very apt to do one or the other.&nbsp; The Pharisee went
so far; he was too bold; he came into the temple making such a
ruffle with his own excellencies, that there was in his thoughts
no need of a Mediator.&nbsp; He also went up so nigh to God, that
he took up the room and place of the Mediator himself; but this
poor Publican, he knows his distance, and keeps it, and leaves
room for the High-priest to come and intercede for him with
God.&nbsp; He stood afar off: not too far off; for that is the
room and place of unbelievers; and in that sense this saying is
true, &ldquo;For, lo, they that are far from thee shall
perish;&rdquo; Psalm lxxiii. 27; that is, they whose unbelief
hath set their hearts and affections more upon their idols, and
that have been made to cast God behind their backs, to follow and
go a-whoring after them.</p>
<p>Hitherto, therefore, it appears, that though the Pharisee had
more righteousness than the Publican, yet the Publican had more
spiritual righteousness than the Pharisee; and that though the
Publican had a baser and more ugly outside than the Pharisee, yet
the Publican knew how to prevail with God for mercy better than
he.</p>
<p>As for the Publican&rsquo;s posture of standing in prayer, it
is excusable, and that by the very Father of the faithful
himself: for Abraham stood praying when he made intercession for
Sodom; Gen. xviii. 22, 23.&nbsp; Christ also alloweth it, where
he saith, &ldquo;And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have
ought against any; that your Father also which is in heaven may
forgive you your trespasses;&rdquo; Mark xi. 25.&nbsp; Indeed
there is no stinted order prescribed for our thus behaving of
ourselves in prayer, whether kneeling, or standing, or walking,
or lying, or sitting; for all these postures have been used by
the godly.&nbsp; Paul &ldquo;kneeled down and prayed;&rdquo; Acts
xx. 36.&nbsp; Abraham and the Publican stood and prayed.&nbsp;
David prayed as he walked; 2 Sam. xv. 30, 31.&nbsp; Abraham
prayed lying upon his face; Gen. xvii. 17,18.&nbsp; Moses prayed
sitting; Exod. xvii. 12.&nbsp; And indeed prayer, effectual
fervent prayer, may be, and often is, made unto God under all
these circumstances of behaviour: for God has not tied us up to
any of them; and he that shall tie himself, or his people, to any
of these, doth more than he hath warrant for from God: and let
such take care of innovating; it is the next way to make men
hypocrites and dissemblers in those duties in which they should
be sincere.</p>
<p>True, which of those soever a man shall choose to himself for
the present, to perform this solemn duty in, it is required of
him, and God expects it, that he should pray to him in truth, and
with desire, affection, and hunger, after those things that with
his tongue he maketh mention of before the throne of God.&nbsp;
And indeed without this, all is nothing.&nbsp; But alas! how few
be there in the world whose heart and mouth in prayer shall go
together?&nbsp; Dost thou, when thou askest for the Spirit, or
faith, or love to God, to holiness, to saints, to the word, and
the like, ask for them with love to them, desire of them,
hungering after them?&nbsp; Oh! this is a mighty thing! and yet
prayer is no more before God, than as it is seasoned with these
blessed qualifications.&nbsp; Wherefore it is said, that while
men are praying, God is searching of the heart, to see what is
the meaning of the Spirit (or whether there be the Spirit and his
meaning in all that the mouth hath uttered, either by words,
sighs, or groans), because it is by him, and through his help
only, that any make prayers according to the will of God; Rom.
viii. 26, 27.&nbsp; Whatever thy posture therefore shall be, see
that thy prayers be pertinent and fervent, not mocking of thine
own soul with words, while thou wantest, and art an utter
stranger to, the very vital and living spirit of prayer.</p>
<p>Now, our Publican had and did exercise the very spirit of
prayer in prayer.&nbsp; He prayed sensibly, seriously,
affectionately, hungering, thirsting, and with longing after that
for which with his mouth he implored the God of heaven; his heart
and soul was in his words, and it was that which made his prayer
<span class="GutSmall">PRAYER</span>; even because he prayed in
<span class="GutSmall">PRAYER</span>; he prayed inwardly as well
as outwardly.</p>
<p>David tells us, that God heard the voice of his supplication,
the voice of his cry, the voice of his tears, and the voice of
his roaring.&nbsp; For indeed are all these acceptable.&nbsp;
Affection and fervent desire make them sound well in the ears of
God.&nbsp; Tears, supplications, prayers, cries, may be all of
them done in formality, hypocrisy, and from other causes, and to
other ends, than that which is honest and right in God&rsquo;s
sight: for God would search and look after the voice of his
tears, supplications, roarings, prayers, and cries.</p>
<p>And if men had less care to please men, and more to please
God, in the matter and manner of praying, the world would be at a
better pass than it is.&nbsp; But this is not in man&rsquo;s
power to help and to amend.&nbsp; When the Holy Ghost comes upon
men with great conviction of their state and condition, and of
the use and excellency of the grace of sincerity and humility in
prayer, then, and not till then, will the grace of prayer be more
prized, and the specious, flounting, complimentary lips of
flatterers, be more laid aside.&nbsp; I have said it already, and
will say it again, that there is now-a-days a great deal of
wickedness committed in the very duty of prayer; by words of
which men have no sense by reaching after such conclusion and
clenshes therein, as make their persons be admired; by studying
for, and labouring after, such enlargements as the spirit
accompanieth not the heart in.&nbsp; O Lord God, make our hearts
upright in us, as in all points and parts of our profession, so
in this solemn appointment of God!&nbsp; &ldquo;If I regard
iniquity in my heart,&rdquo; said David, &ldquo;the Lord will not
hear my prayer.&rdquo;&nbsp; But if I be truly sincere, he will;
and then it is no matter whether I kneel, or stand, or sit, or
lie, or walk; for I shall do none of these, nor put up my prayers
under any of these circumstances, lightly, foolishly, and idly,
but to beautify this gesture with the inward working of my mind
and spirit in prayer; that whether I stand or sit, walk or lie
down, grace and gravity, humility and sincerity, shall make my
prayer profitable, and my outward behaviour comely in his eyes,
with whom (in prayer) I now have to do.</p>
<p>And had not our Publican been inwardly seasoned with these,
Christ would have taken but little pleasure in his modes and
outward behaviour: but being so honest inwardly, and in the
matter of his prayer, his gestures by that were made beauteous
also; and therefore it is that our Lord so delightfully delateth
upon them, and draweth them out at length before the eyes of
others.</p>
<p>I have often observed, that which is natural and so comely in
one, looks odiously when imitated by another.&nbsp; I speak as to
gestures and actions in preaching and prayer.&nbsp; Many, I doubt
not, but will imitate the Publican, and that both in the prayer
and gestures of the Publican, whose persons and actions will yet
stink in the nostrils of him that is holy and just, and that
searcheth the heart and the reins.</p>
<p>Well, the Publican stood and prayed; he stood afar off, and
prayed, and his prayers came even to the ears of God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Publican standing afar off would not lift up so
much as his eyes to heaven,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>We are now come to another of his postures.&nbsp; He would
not, says the text, so much as lift up his eyes to heaven.&nbsp;
Here, therefore, was another gesture added to that which went
before; and a gesture that a great while before had been
condemned by the Holy Ghost himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it such a
fast that I have chosen, a day for a man to afflict his
soul?&nbsp; Is it to bow down his head as a bulrush?&rdquo; Isa.
lviii. 5.</p>
<p>But why condemned then, and smiled upon now?&nbsp; Why?&nbsp;
Because done in hypocrisy then, and in sincerity now.&nbsp;
Hypocrisy, and a spirit of error, that he shall take no pleasure
in them; but sincerity, and honesty in duties, will make even
them comely in the sight of men&mdash;may I not say before
God?&nbsp; The Rechabites were not commanded of God, but of their
father, to do as they did; but, because they were sincere in
their obedience thereto, even God himself maketh use of what they
did, to condemn the disobedience of the Jews; and, moreover, doth
tell the Rechabites at last, that they should not want a man to
stand before him for ever.&nbsp; &ldquo;And Jeremiah said unto
the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, the
God of Israel, because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab
your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto
all that he hath commanded you; therefore, thus saith the Lord of
Hosts, the God of Israel, Jonadab, the son of Rechab, shall not
want a man to stand before me for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He would not lift up his eyes to heaven.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp;
Surely because shame had covered his face.&nbsp; Shame will make
a man blush and hang his head like a bulrush; shame for sin is a
virtue, a comely thing; yea, a beauty-spot in the face of a
sinner that cometh to God for mercy.</p>
<p>God complains of the house of Israel, that they could sin, and
that without shame; yea, and threateneth them too with sore
repeated judgments, because they were not ashamed; it is in Jer.
viii.&nbsp; Their crimes in general were, they turned every one
to his course, as the horse runneth into the battle.&nbsp; In
particular, they were such as rejected God&rsquo;s word; they
loved this world, and set themselves against the prophets,
crying, &ldquo;Peace, peace,&rdquo; when they cried,
&ldquo;Judgment, judgment!&rdquo;&nbsp; And were not ashamed when
they had committed abomination; &ldquo;Nay, they were not at all
ashamed, neither could they blush; therefore shall they fall
among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall
be cast down, saith the Lord;&rdquo; ver. 12.&nbsp; Oh! to stand,
or sit, or lie, or kneel, or walk before God in prayer, with
blushing cheeks for sin, is one of the most excellent sights that
can be seen in the world.</p>
<p>Wherefore the church taketh some kind of heart to herself in
that she could lie down in her shame; yea, and makes that a kind
of an argument with God to prove that her prayers did come from
her heart, and also that he would hear them; Jer. iii.
22&ndash;25.</p>
<p>Shame for sin argueth sense of sin, yea, a right sense of sin,
a godly sense of sin.&nbsp; Ephraim pleads this when under the
hand of God: I was (saith he) &ldquo;ashamed, yea, even
confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my
youth.&rdquo;&nbsp; But what follows?&nbsp; &ldquo;Is Ephraim my
dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I spake against him,
I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my bowels are
troubled for him: I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the
Lord;&rdquo; Jer. xxxi. 19, 20.</p>
<p>I know that there is a shame that is not the spirit of an
honest heart, but that rather floweth from sudden surprisal, when
the sinner is unawares taken in the act&mdash;in the very
manner.&nbsp; And thus sometimes the house of Israel were taken:
and then, when they blushed, their shame is compared to the shame
of a thief.&nbsp; &ldquo;As the thief is ashamed when he is
found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings,
their princes, and their priests, and their prophets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But where were they taken, or about what were they
found?&nbsp; Why, they were found &ldquo;saying to a stock, Thou
art my father, and to a stone, thou hast brought me
forth.&rdquo;&nbsp; God catched them thus doing; and this made
them ashamed, even as the thief is ashamed when the owner doth
catch him stealing his horse.</p>
<p>But this was not the Publican&rsquo;s shame.&nbsp; This shame
brings not a man into the temple to pray, to stand willingly, and
to take shame before God in prayer.&nbsp; This shame makes one
rather to fly from his face, and to count one&rsquo;s self most
at ease when farthest off from God; Jer. ii. 26, 27.</p>
<p>The Publican&rsquo;s shame, therefore, which he demonstrated
by hanging down his head, was godly and holy, and much like that
of the prodigal, when he said, &ldquo;Father, I have sinned
against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be
called thy son;&rdquo; Luke xv. 21.&nbsp; I suppose that his
postures were much the same with the Publican&rsquo;s, as were
his prayers, for the substance of them.&nbsp; O however grace did
work in both to the same end! they were both of them, after a
godly manner, ashamed of their sins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would not lift up so much as his eyes to
heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could not, he would not: which yet more fully makes it
appear, that it was shame, not guilt only, or chiefly, though it
is manifest enough that he had guilt; by his crying, &ldquo;God
be merciful to me a sinner.&rdquo;&nbsp; I say, guilt was not the
chief cause of hanging down his head, because it saith, he
<i>would</i> not; for when guilt is the cause of stooping, it
lieth not in the will, or in the power thereof, to help one
up.</p>
<p>David tells us, that when he was under guilt, his iniquities
were gone over his head: as an heavy burden, they were too heavy
for him; and that with them he was bowed down greatly.&nbsp; Or,
as he says in another place, &ldquo;Mine iniquities have taken
hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up;&rdquo; Psalm
xxxviii.; xl.&nbsp; I am not able to do it: guilt disableth the
understanding, and conscience; shame makes all willingly fall at
the feet of Christ.</p>
<p>He would not.&nbsp; He knew what he was, what he had been, and
should be, if God had not mercy upon him; yea, he knew also that
God knew what he was, had been, and would be, if mercy prevented
not; wherefore, thought he, Wherefore should I lift up the
head?&nbsp; I am no righteous man, no godly man, I have not
served God, but Satan; this I know, this God knows, this angels
know, wherefore I will not lift up the head.&nbsp; It is as much
as to say, I will not be an hypocrite, like the Pharisee: for
lifting up of the head signifies innocency and harmlessness of
life, or good conscience, and the testimony thereof, under and in
the midst of all accusations.&nbsp; Wherefore this was the
counsel of Zophar to Job&mdash;&ldquo;If,&rdquo; saith he,
&ldquo;thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hand
towards him; if iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and
let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.&nbsp; For then shalt
thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be steadfast,
and shalt not fear;&rdquo; Job xi. 13&ndash;15.</p>
<p>This was not the Publican&rsquo;s state: he had lived in
lewdness and villany all his days; nor had he prepared his heart
to seek the Lord God of his fathers; he had not cleansed his
heart nor hands from violence, nor done that which was lawful and
right.&nbsp; He only had been convinced of his evil ways, and was
come into the temple as he was, all foul, and in his filthy
garments, and amidst his pollutions; how then could he be
innocent, holy, or without spot? and, consequently, how could he
lift up his face to God?&nbsp; I remember what Abner said to
Asahel, &ldquo;Turn thee aside (said he) from following me,
wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I
hold up my face to Joab, thy brother?&rdquo;&nbsp; 2 Sam. ii.
22.</p>
<p>As if he had said, If I kill thee, I shall blush, be ashamed,
and hang my head like a bulrush the next time I come into the
company of thy brother.</p>
<p>This was the Publican&rsquo;s case: he was guilty, he had
sinned, he had committed a trespass; and now being come into the
temple, into the presence of that God whose laws he had broken,
and against whom he had sinned, how could he lift up his head?
how could he do it?&nbsp; No, it better became him to take his
shame, and to hang his head in token of guilt; and indeed he did,
and did it to purpose too, for he would not lift up, no not so
much as his eyes to heaven.</p>
<p>True, some would have done it; the Pharisee did it; though if
he had considered that hypocrisy and the leaning to his own
righteousness had been a sin, he would have found as little cause
to have done it as did the Publican himself.&nbsp; But, I say he
did it, and sped therein; he went down to his house, as he came
up into the temple, a poor unjustified Pharisee, whose person and
prayer were both rejected; because, like the whore of whom we
read in the Proverbs, after he had practised all manner of
hypocrisy, he comes into the temple and wipes his mouth, and
saith, &ldquo;I have done no wickedness;&rdquo; Prov. xxx.
20.&nbsp; He lifts up his head, his face, his eyes, to heaven; he
struts, he vaunts himself; he swaggers, he vapours, and cries up
himself, saying, &ldquo;God I thank thee that I am not as other
men are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>True, had he come and stood before a stock or stone, he might
have said thus, and not have been reprehended; for such are gods
that see not, nor hear, neither do they understand.&nbsp; But to
come before the true God, the living God, the God that fills
heaven and earth by his presence, and that knows the things that
come into the mind of man, even every one of them; I say, to come
into his house, to stand before him, and thus to lift up his head
and eyes in such hypocrisy before him, this was abominable, this
was to tempt God, and to prove him, yea, to challenge him to know
what was in man, if he could, even as those who said, &ldquo;How
doth God (see) know? can he judge through the dark
cloud?&rdquo;&nbsp; Job xxii. 13; Psalm lxxiii. 11.</p>
<p>But the Publican&mdash;no&mdash;he would not do this; he would
not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven.&nbsp; As who should
say, O Lord, I have been against thee a traitor and a rebel, and
like a traitor and a rebel before thee will I stand.&nbsp; I will
bear my shame before thee in the presence of the holy angels;
yea, I will prevent thy judging of me by judging myself in thy
sight, and will stand as condemned before thee before thou
passest sentence upon me.</p>
<p>This is now for a sinner to go to the end of things.&nbsp; For
what is God&rsquo;s design in the work of conviction for sin, and
in his awakening of the conscience about it?&nbsp; What is his
end, I say, but to make the sinner sensible of what he hath done,
and that he might unfeignedly judge himself for the same.&nbsp;
Now this our Publican doth; his will therefore is now subjected
to the word of God, and he justifies him in all his ways and
works towards him.&nbsp; Blessed be God for any experience of
these things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would not lift up so much as his eyes to
heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; He knew by his deeds and deservings that he
had no portion there; nor would he divert his mind from the
remembering, and from being affected with the evil of his
ways.</p>
<p>Some men, when they are under the guilt and conviction of
their evil life, will do what they can to look any way, and that
on purpose to divert their minds, and to call them off from
thinking on what they have done; and by their thus doing, they
bring many evils more upon their souls; for this is a kind of
striving with God, and a shewing a dislike to his ways.&nbsp;
Would not you think, if when you are shewing your son or your
servant his faults, if he should do what he could to divert and
take off his mind from what you are saying, that he striveth
against you, and sheweth dislike of your doings?&nbsp; What else
mean the complaints of masters and of fathers in this
matter?&nbsp; &ldquo;I have a servant, I have a son, that doth
contrary to my will.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;O but why do you not
chide them for it?&rdquo;&nbsp; The answer is, &ldquo;So I do;
but they do not regard my words; they do what they can, even
while I am speaking, to divert their minds from my words and
counsels.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why, all men will cry out, &ldquo;This is
base; this is worthy of great rebuke; such a son, such a servant,
deserveth to be shut out of doors, and so made to learn better
breeding by want and hardship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Publican would not divert his mind from what at
present God was about to make him sensible of, no, not by a look
on the choicest object; he would not lift up so much as his eyes
to heaven.&nbsp; They are but bad scholars whose eyes, when their
master is teaching of them, are wandering off their books.</p>
<p>God saith unto men, when he is teaching them to know the evil
of their ways, as the angel said to the prophet when he came to
shew him the pattern of the temple, &ldquo;Son of man,&rdquo;
says he, &ldquo;behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears,
and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew thee; for to the
intent that I might shew them unto thee art thou brought
hither;&rdquo; Ezek. xl. 4.&nbsp; So to the intent that God might
shew to the Publican the evil of his ways, therefore was he
brought under the power of convictions, and the terrors of the
law; and he also, like a good learner, gave good heed unto that
lesson that now he was learning of God; for he would not lift up
so much as his eyes to heaven.</p>
<p>Looking downwards doth ofttimes bespeak men very ponderous and
deep in their cogitations; also that the matter about which in
their minds they are now concerned hath taken great hold of their
spirits.&nbsp; The Publican hath now new things, great things,
and long-lived things, to concern himself about: his sins, the
curse, with death, and hell, began now to stare him in the face:
wherefore it was no time now to let his heart, or his eyes, or
his cogitations, wander, but to be fixed, and to be vehemently
applying of himself (as a sinner) to the God of heaven for
mercy.</p>
<p>Few know the weight of sin.&nbsp; When the guilt thereof takes
hold of the conscience, it commands homewards all the faculties
of the soul.&nbsp; No man can go out or off now: now he is
wind-bound, or, as Paul says, &ldquo;caught:&rdquo; now he is
made to possess bitter days, bitter nights, bitter hours, bitter
thoughts; nor can he shift them, for his sin is ever before
him.&nbsp; As David said, &ldquo;For I acknowledge my
transgressions: and my sin is ever before me,&rdquo;&mdash;in my
eye, and sticketh fast in every one of my thoughts; Psalm li.
3.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven, but
smote upon his breast.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was the third and last
of his gestures; he &ldquo;Smote upon his breast,&rdquo; to wit,
with his hand, or with his fist.&nbsp; I read of several gestures
with the hand and foot, according to the working and passions of
the mind.&nbsp; It is said, &ldquo;Balak smote his hands
together,&rdquo; being angry because that Balaam had blessed and
not cursed for him the children of Israel.</p>
<p>God says also, that he had smitten his hands together at the
sins of the children of Israel.&nbsp; God also bids the prophet
stamp with his feet, and smite with his hand upon his thigh (Num.
xxiv. 10; Ezek. xxii. 13; vi. 11; xxi. 12), upon sundry
occasions, and at several enormities; but the Publican here is
said to smite upon his breast.&nbsp; And,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Smiting upon the breast betokeneth sorrow for
something done.&nbsp; This is an experiment common among men; and
indeed, therefore (as I take it), doth our Lord Jesus put him
under this gesture in the act and exercise of his repentance,
because it is that which doth most lively set it forth.</p>
<p>Suppose a man comes to great damage for some folly that he has
wrought, and he be made sorrowful for (being and) doing such
folly, there is nothing more common than for such a man (if he
may) to walk to and fro in the room where he is, with head hung
down, fetching ever and anon a bitter sigh, and smiting himself
upon the breast in his dejected condition: &ldquo;But smote upon
his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Smiting upon the breast is sometimes a token of
indignation and abhorrence of something thought upon.&nbsp; I
read in Luke, that when Christ was crucified, those spectators
that stood to behold the barbarous usage that he endured at the
hands of his enemies, smote their breasts and returned.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And all the people (says Luke) that came together to that
sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts
and returned;&rdquo; Luke xxiii. 48.&nbsp; Smote their breasts;
that is, in token of indignation against, and abhorrence of, the
cruelty that was used to the Son of God.</p>
<p>Here also we have our Publican smiting upon his breast in
token of indignation against, and abhorrence of, his former life;
and indeed, without indignation against, and abhorrence of, his
former life, his repentance had not been good.&nbsp; Wherefore
the apostle doth make indignation against sin, and against
ourselves, one of the signs of true repentance; 2 Cor. vii. 11;
and his indignation against sin in general, and against his
former life in particular, was manifested by his smiting upon the
breast, even as Ephraim&rsquo;s smiting upon the thigh was a sign
and token of his: &ldquo;Surely (says he), after that I was
turned, I repented: and after that I was instructed, I smote upon
my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear
the reproach of my youth;&rdquo; Jer. xxxi. 19.&nbsp; Man, when
he vehemently dislikes a thing, is very apt to shew a dislike to
that thing by this or another outward gesture; as in snuffing or
snorting at it, or in deriding; or, as some say, in blowing of
their noses at it; Ezek. viii. 17; Mal. i. 13.&nbsp; But the
Publican here chooseth rather to use this most solemn posture;
for smiting upon the breast seems to imply a more serious,
solemn, grave way or manner of dislike, than any of those last
mentioned do.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Smiting upon the breast seems to intimate a quarrel
with the heart, for beguiling, deluding, flattering, seducing,
and enticing of him to sin; for as conviction for sin begets in
man (I mean if it be thorough) a sense of the sore and plague of
the heart, so repentance (if it be right) begets in man an outcry
against the heart; forasmuch as by that light, by which
repentance takes occasion, the sinner is made to see that the
heart is the fountain and well-spring of sin.&nbsp; &ldquo;For
from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts,
adulteries, covetousness,&rdquo; &amp;c.; Mark vii.
21&ndash;23.&nbsp; And hence it is that commonly young converts
do complain so of their hearts, calling them wicked, treacherous,
deceitful, desperate ones.</p>
<p>Indeed, one difference between true and false repentance lieth
in this.&nbsp; The man that truly repents crieth out of his
heart; but the other, as Eve, upon the serpent, or something
else.&nbsp; And that the Publican perceived his heart to be
naught, I conclude, by his smiting upon his breast.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Smiting upon the breast seems to intimate one
apprehensive of some new, sudden, strange, and amazing thing; as
when a man sees some strange sight in the air, or heareth some
sudden or dismal sound in the clouds; why, as he is struck into a
deep damp in his mind, so it is a wonder if he can keep or hold
back from smiting upon his breast.</p>
<p>Now, oftentimes a sight of God and sense of sin comes to the
sinner like a flash of lightning (not for short continuance, but)
for suddeness, and so for surprisal; so that the sinner is
struck, taken and captivated to his own amazement, with what so
unexpectedly is come upon him.&nbsp; It is said of Paul at his
conversion, that when conviction of his bad life took fast hold
of his conscience, he trembled, and was astonished (Acts ix. 6);
and although we read not of any particular circumstance of his
behaviour under his conviction outwardly, yet it is almost
impossible but he must have had some, and those of the most solid
sort.&nbsp; For there is such a sympathy betwixt the soul and the
body, that the one cannot be in distress or comfort, but the
other must partake of and also signify the same.&nbsp; If it be
comfort, then it is shewn by leaping, skipping, cheerfulness of
the countenance, or some other outward gesture.&nbsp; If it be
sorrow or heaviness of spirit, then that is shewed by the body,
in weeping, sighing, groaning, shaking of the head, a louring
countenance, stamping, smiting upon the thigh or breast, as here
the Publican did.</p>
<p>We must not, therefore, look upon these outward actions or
gestures of the Publican to be empty, insignificant things; but
to be such, that in truth did express and shew the temper, frame,
and complexion of his soul.&nbsp; For Christ, the wisdom of God,
hath mentioned them to that very end, that in and by them might
be held forth, and that men might see as in a glass, the very
emblem of a converted and truly penitent sinner.&nbsp; He
&ldquo;smote upon his breast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Smiting upon the breast is sometimes to signify a
mixture of distrust, joined with hope.&nbsp; And, indeed, in
young converts, hope and distrust, or a degree of despair, do
work and answer one another, as doth the noise of the balance of
the watch in the pocket.&nbsp; Life and death is always the
motion of the mind then, and this noise continues until faith is
stronger grown, and until the soul is better acquainted with the
methods and ways of God with a sinner.&nbsp; Yea, were but a
carnal man in a convert&rsquo;s heart, and could see, he could
discern these two, to wit, hope and fear, to have continual
motion in the soul; wrestling and opposing one another, as doth
light and darkness in striving for the victory.</p>
<p>And hence it is that you find such people so fickle and
uncertain in their spirits; now on the mount, then in the
valleys; now in the sunshine, then in the shade: now warm, then
frozen; now bonny and blithe, then in a moment pensive and sad,
as thinking of a portion nowhere but in hell.&nbsp; This will
cause smiting on the breast; nor can I imagine that the Publican
was as yet farther than thus far in the Christian&rsquo;s
progress.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Smiting upon the breast seems to intimate, that the
party so doing is very apprehensive of some great loss that he
has sustained, either by negligence, carelessness, foolishness,
or the like.&nbsp; And this is the way in which men do lose their
souls.&nbsp; Now, to lose a thing, a great thing, the only choice
thing that a man has, negligently, carelessly, foolishly, or the
like, why, it puts aggravations into the thoughts of the loss
that the man has sustained, and aggravations into the thoughts of
them go out of the soul, and come in upon a sudden, even as the
bailiff or the king&rsquo;s serjeant-at-arms, and at every
appearance of them, makes the soul start; and starting, it smites
upon the breast.</p>
<p>I might multiply particulars; but to be brief, we have before
us a sensible soul, a sorrowful soul, a penitent soul; one that
prays indeed, that prays sensibly, affectionately, effectually;
one that sees his loss, that fears and trembles before God in
consideration of it, and one that knows no way but the right way,
to secure himself from perishing, to wit, by having humble and
hearty recourse to the God of heaven for mercy.</p>
<p>I should now come to speak something by way of use and
application: but before I do that, I will briefly draw up, and
present you with a few conclusions that in my judgment do
naturally flow from the text; therefore in this place I will read
over the text again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a
Pharisee, the other a Publican.&nbsp; The Pharisee stood and
prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as
other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this
Publican.&nbsp; I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all
that I possess.&nbsp; And the Publican standing afar off would
not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his
breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From these words I gather these several conclusions, with
these inferences.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; It doth not always follow, that they that pray do
know God, or love him, or trust in him.&nbsp; This conclusion is
evident by the Pharisee in the text; he prayed, but he knew not
God, he loved not God, he trusted not in God; that is, he knew
him not in his Son, nor loved, nor trusted in him.&nbsp; He was,
though a praying man, far off from this.</p>
<p>Whence it may be inferred, that those that pray not at all
cannot be good, cannot know, love, or trust in God.&nbsp; For if
the star, though it shine, is not the sun, then surely a clod of
dirt cannot be the sun.&nbsp; Why, a praying man doth as far
outstrip a non-praying man as a star outstrips a clod of
earth.&nbsp; A non-praying man lives like a beast.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master&rsquo;s
crib; but this man doth not know, but this man doth not
consider;&rdquo; Isa. i. 3.&nbsp; The prayerless man is therefore
of no religion, except he be an Atheist, or an Epicurean.&nbsp;
Therefore the non-praying man is numbered among the heathens, and
among those that know not God, and is appointed and designed by
the sentence of the word to the fearful wrath of God; Psal.
lxxix. 6; Jer. x. 25.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; A second conclusion is, That the man that prays, if
in his prayer he pleads for acceptance, either in whole or in
part, for his own good deeds, is in a miserable state.&nbsp; This
also is gathered from the Pharisee here; he prayed, but in this
prayer he pleaded his own good deeds for acceptance, that is, of
his person, and therefore went down to his house
unjustified.&nbsp; And he is in this condition that doth
thus.&nbsp; The conclusion is true, forasmuch as the Pharisee
mentioned in the parable is not so spoken of for the sake of that
sect of men, but to caution, forewarn, and bid all men take heed,
that they by doing as he, procure not their rejection of God, and
be sent away from his presence unjustified.&nbsp; I do therefore
infer from hence, that if he that pleadeth his own good doing for
personal acceptance with God be thus miserable, then he that
teacheth men so to do is much more miserable.</p>
<p>We always conclude, that a ring-leader in an evil way is more
blame-worthy than those that are led of him.&nbsp; This falls
hard upon the leading Socinians and others, who teach that
men&rsquo;s works make their persons accepted of God.</p>
<p>True, they say, through Christ; but that is brought in merely
to delude the simple with, and is an horrible lie; for we read
not in all the word of God as to personal justification in the
sight of God from the curse (and that is the question under
consideration), that it must be by man&rsquo;s righteousness as
made prevalent by Christ&rsquo;s, but contrariwise, by his and
his only, without the deeds, works, or righteousness of the law,
which is our righteousness.&nbsp; Wherefore, I say, the teachers
and leaders of this doctrine have the greater sin.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; A third conclusion is, They that use high and
flaunting language in prayer, their simplicity and godly
sincerity is to be questioned as to the doing of that duty
sincerely.&nbsp; This still flows from our text; the Pharisee
greatly used this: for higher and more flaunting language can
hardly be found than in the Pharisee&rsquo;s mouth; nor will
ascribing to God by the same mouth laud and praise help the
business at all: for to be sure, where the effect is base and
rotten, the cause cannot be good.</p>
<p>The Pharisee would hold himself that he was not as other men,
and then gives thanks to God for this: but the conclusion was
most vilely false, and therefore the praise for it could not but
be foolish, vain, and frivolous.&nbsp; Whence I infer, that if to
use such language in prayer is dangerous, then to affect the use
thereof is yet more dangerous.&nbsp; Prayer must be made with
humble hearts and sensible words, and of that we have treated
before; wherefore high, flaunting, swelling words of vanity,
become not a sinner&rsquo;s mouth; no, not at any time; much less
when he comes to, and presents himself before God in that solemn
duty of prayer.&nbsp; But, I say, there are some that so affect
the Pharisee&rsquo;s mode, that they cannot be well if in some
sort or other they be not in the practice of it, not knowing what
they say, nor whereof they affirm; but these are greatly addicted
to hypocrisy and desire of vain-glory, especially if the sound of
their words be within the reach of other men&rsquo;s ears.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; A fourth conclusion is, That reformation and
amendment, though good, and before men, are nothing as to
justification with God.&nbsp; This is manifest by the condition
of our Pharisee: he was a reformed man, a man beyond others for
personal righteousness, yet he went out of the temple from God
unjustified; his works came to nothing with God.&nbsp; Hence I
infer, that the man that hath nothing to commend him to God of
his own, yet stands as fair before God for justification, and so
acceptance, as any other man in the world.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; A fifth conclusion is, It is the sensible sinner, the
self-bemoaning sinner, the self-judging sinner, the
self-abhorring sinner, and the self-condemning sinner, whose
prayers prevail with God for mercy.&nbsp; Hence I infer, that one
reason why men make so many prayers, and prevail no more with God
is, because their prayers are rather the floatings of Pharisaical
fancies than the fruits of sound sense of sin, and sincere
desires of enjoying God in mercy, and in the fruits of the Holy
Ghost.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
